<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>One of these days some one will give us a hand-book of our wild flowers,
by the aid of which we shall all be able to name those we gather in our
walks without the trouble of analyzing them. In this book we shall have a
list of all our flowers arranged according to color, as white flowers, blue
flowers, yellow flowers, pink flowers, etc., with place of growth and time of
blooming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The pleasure of a walk in the woods and fields is enhanced a
hundredfold by some little knowledge of the flowers which we
meet at every turn. Their names alone serve as a clew to their
entire histories, giving us that sense of companionship with our
surroundings which is so necessary to the full enjoyment of outdoor
life. But if we have never studied botany it has been no
easy matter to learn these names, for we find that the very people
who have always lived among the flowers are often ignorant of
even their common titles, and frequently increase our eventual
confusion by naming them incorrectly. While it is more than
probable that any attempt to attain our end by means of some
“Key,” which positively bristles with technical terms and outlandish
titles, has only led us to replace the volume in despair,
sighing with Emerson, that these scholars</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all their botany is Latin names!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>So we have ventured to hope that such a book as this will
not be altogether unwelcome, and that our readers will find that
even a bowing acquaintance with the flowers repays one generously
for the effort expended in its achievement. Such an
acquaintance serves to transmute the tedium of a railway journey
into the excitement of a tour of discovery. It causes the
monotony of a drive through an ordinarily uninteresting country
to be forgotten in the diversion of noting the wayside flowers,
and counting a hundred different species where formerly less
than a dozen would have been detected. It invests each boggy
meadow and bit of rocky woodland with almost irresistible charm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Surely Sir John Lubbock is right in maintaining that “those
who love Nature can never be dull,” provided that love be expressed
by an intelligent interest rather than by a purely sentimental
rapture.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ninety-seven of the one hundred and four plates in this
book are from original drawings from nature. Of the remaining
seven plates, six (Nos. LXXX., XCIX., CI., XXII., XLII.,
LXXXI.), and the illustration of the complete flower, in the
Explanation of Terms, are adapted with alterations from standard
authors, part of the work in the first three plates mentioned being
original. Plate IV. has been adapted from “American Medicinal
Plants,” by kind permission of the author, Dr. C. F. Millspaugh.
The reader should always consult the “Flower Descriptions” in
order to learn the actual dimensions of the different plants, as it
has not always been possible to preserve their relative sizes in the
illustrations. The aim in the drawings has been to help the
reader to identify the flowers described in the text, and to this
end they are presented as simply as possible, with no attempt at
artistic arrangement or grouping.</p>

<p class='c004'>We desire to express our thanks to Miss Harriet Procter, of
Cincinnati, for her assistance and encouragement. Acknowledgment
of their kind help is also due to Mrs. Seth Doane, of
Orleans, Massachusetts, and to Mr. Eugene P. Bicknell, of Riverdale,
New York. To Dr. N. L. Britton, of Columbia College,
we are indebted for permission to work in the College Herbarium.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>HOW TO USE THE BOOK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Many difficulties have been encountered in the arrangement
of this guide to the flowers. To be really useful such a guide
must be of moderate size, easily carried in the woods and fields;
yet there are so many flowers, and there is so much to say about
them, that we have been obliged to control our selection and
descriptions by certain regulations which we hope will commend
themselves to the intelligence of our readers and secure their
indulgence should any special favorite be conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p class='c004'>These regulations may be formulated briefly as follows:</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Flowers so common as to be generally recognized are
omitted, unless some peculiarity or fact in their history entitles
them to special mention.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under this, Buttercups, Wild Roses, Thistles, and others are
ruled out.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Flowers so inconspicuous as generally to escape notice are
usually omitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Ragweed, Plantain, and others are excluded.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. Rare flowers and escapes from gardens are usually omitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. Those flowers are chosen for illustration which seem entitled
to prominence on account of their beauty, interest, or frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. Flowers which have less claim upon the general public
than those chosen for illustration and full description, yet which
are sufficiently common or conspicuous to arouse occasional curiosity,
are necessarily dismissed with as brief a description as
seems compatible with their identification.</p>

<p class='c004'>In parts of New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>and in the vicinity of Washington, I have been enabled to
describe many of our wild flowers from personal observation; and
I have endeavored to increase the usefulness of the book by including
as well those comparatively few flowers not found within
the range mentioned, but commonly encountered at some point
this side of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c004'>The grouping according to color was suggested by a passage
in one of Mr. Burroughs’s “Talks about Flowers.” It seemed,
on careful consideration, to offer an easier identification than
any other arrangement. One is constantly asked the name of
some “little blue flower,” or some “large pink flower,” noted
by the wayside. While both the size and color of a flower fix
themselves in the mind of the casual observer, the color is the
more definitely appreciated characteristic of the two and serves
far better as a clew to its identification.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the flowers are brought in from the woods and fields
they should be sorted according to color and then traced to their
proper places in the various sections. As far as possible the
flowers have been arranged according to the seasons’ sequence,
the spring flowers being placed in the first part of each section,
the summer flowers next, and the autumn flowers last.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has sometimes been difficult to determine the proper position
of a flower—blues, purples, and pinks shading so gradually
one into another as to cause difference of opinion as to the color
of a blossom among the most accurate. So if the object of our
search is not found in the first section consulted, we must turn to
that other one which seems most likely to include it.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has seemed best to place in the White section those flowers
which are so faintly tinted with other colors as to give a white
effect in the mass, or when seen at a distance. Some flowers are
so green as to seem almost entitled to a section of their own, but
if closely examined the green is found to be so diluted with white
as to render them describable by the term <i>greenish-white</i>. A
white flower veined with pink will also be described in the White
section, unless its general effect should be so pink as to entitle it
to a position in the Pink section. Such a flower again as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>Painted Cup is placed in the Red section because its floral leaves
are so red that probably none but the botanist would appreciate
that the actual flowers were yellow. Flowers which fail to suggest
any definite color are relegated to the Miscellaneous section.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the description of each flower is given—</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Its common English name—if one exists. This may be
looked upon as its “nickname,” a title attached to it by chance,
often endeared to us by long association, the name by which it
may be known in one part of the country but not necessarily in
another, and about which, consequently, a certain amount of
disagreement and confusion often arises.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Its scientific name. This compensates for its frequent
lack of euphony by its other advantages. It is usually composed
of two Latin—or Latinized—words, and is the same in all parts
of the world (which fact explains the necessity of its Latin form).
Whatever confusion may exist as to a flower’s English name, its
scientific one is an accomplished fact—except in those rare cases
where an undescribed species is encountered—and rarely admits
of dispute. The first word of this title indicates the <i>genus</i> of the
plant. It is a substantive, answering to the last or family name
of a person, and shows the relationship of all the plants which
bear it. The second word indicates the <i>species</i>. It is usually
an adjective, which betrays some characteristic of the plant, or it
may indicate the part of the country in which it is found, or the
person in whose honor it was named.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. The English title of the larger Family to which the plant
belongs. All flowers grouped under this title have in common
certain important features which in many cases are too obscure
to be easily recognized; while in others they are quite obvious.
One who wishes to identify the flowers with some degree of ease
should learn to recognize at sight such Families as present conspicuously
characteristic features.</p>

<p class='c004'>For fuller definitions, explanations, and descriptions than
are here given, Gray’s text-books and “Manual” should be
consulted. After some few flowers have been compared with
the partially technical description which prefaces each popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>one, little difficulty should be experienced in the use of a botanical
key. Many of the measurements and technical descriptions
have been based upon Gray’s “Manual.” It has been
thought best to omit any mention of species and varieties not included
in the latest edition of that work.</p>

<p class='c004'>An ordinary magnifying glass (such as can be bought for
seventy-five cents), a sharp penknife, and one or two dissecting-needles
will be found useful in the examination of the smaller
flowers. The use of a note-book, with jottings as to the date,
color, surroundings, etc., of any newly identified flower, is recommended.
This habit impresses on the memory easily forgotten
but important details. Such a book is also valuable for further
reference, both for our own satisfaction when some point which
our experience had already determined has been forgotten, and
for the settlement of the many questions which are sure to arise
among flower-lovers as to the localities in which certain flowers
are found, the dates at which they may be expected to appear
and disappear, and various other points which even the scientific
books sometimes fail to decide.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of the flowers described are found along every country
highway. It is interesting to note that these wayside flowers
may usually be classed among the foreign population. They
have been brought to us from Europe in ballast and in loads of
grain, and invariably follow in the wake of civilization. Many
of our most beautiful native flowers have been crowded out of
the hospitable roadside by these aggressive, irresistible, and mischievous
invaders; for Mr. Burroughs points out that nearly
all of our troublesome weeds are emigrants from Europe. We
must go to the more remote woods and fields if we wish really to
know our native plants. Swamps especially offer an eagerly
sought asylum to our shy and lovely wild flowers.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Until a comparatively recent period the interest in plants
centred largely in the medicinal properties, and sometimes in
the supernatural powers, which were attributed to them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

</div>

<p class='c013'>sang Spenser in the “Faerie Queene;” and to this day the names
of many of our wayside plants bear witness, not alone to the
healing properties which their owners were supposed to possess,
but also to the firm hold which the so-called “doctrine of signatures”
had upon the superstitious mind of the public. In an
early work on “The Art of Simpling,” by one William Coles,
we read as follows: “Yet the mercy of God which is over all
his works, maketh Grasse to grow upon the Mountains and Herbes
for the use of men, and hath not only stamped upon them a distinct
forme, but also given them particular signatures, whereby a
man may read, even in legible characters, the use of them.”
Our hepatica or liver-leaf, owes both its generic and English
titles to its leaves, which suggested the form of the organ after
which the plant is named, and caused it to be considered “a
sovereign remedy against the heat and inflammation of the
liver.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Although his once-renowned system of classification has
since been discarded on account of its artificial character, it is
probably to Linnæus that the honor is due of having raised the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>study of plants to a rank which had never before been accorded
it. The Swedish naturalist contrived to inspire his disciples
with an enthusiasm and to invest the flowers with a charm and
personality which awakened a wide-spread interest in the subject.
It is only since his day that the unscientific nature-lover,
wandering through those woods and fields where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>—wide around, the marriage of the plants</div>
      <div class='line'>Is sweetly solemnized—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>has marvelled to find the same laws in vogue in the floral as in
the animal world.</p>

<p class='c004'>To Darwin we owe our knowledge of the significance of
color, form, and fragrance in flowers. These subjects have been
widely discussed during the last twenty-five years, because of
their close connection with the theory of natural selection; they
have also been more or less enlarged upon in modern text-books.
Nevertheless, it seems wiser to repeat what is perhaps already
known to the reader, and to allude to some of the interesting
theories connected with these topics, rather than to incur the risk
of obscurity by omitting all explanation of facts and deductions
to which it is frequently necessary to refer.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is agreed that the object of a flower’s life is the making of
seed, <i>i.e.</i>, the continuance of its kind. Consequently its most
essential parts are its reproductive organs, the stamens, and the
pistil or pistils.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stamens (p. <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>) are the fertilizing organs. These produce
the powdery, quickening material called pollen, in little
sacs which are borne at the tips of their slender stalks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pistil (p. <a href='#Page_11'>11</a>) is the seed-bearing organ. The pollen-grains
which are deposited on its roughened summit throw out
minute tubes which reach the little ovules in the ovary below
and quicken them into life.</p>

<p class='c004'>These two kinds of organs can easily be distinguished in any
large, simple, complete flower (p. <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>). The pollen of the stamens,
and the ovules which line the base of the pistil, can also
be detected with the aid of an ordinary magnifying glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, we have been shown that nature apparently prefers that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the pistil of a flower should not receive its pollen from the stamens
in the same flower-cup with itself. Experience teaches that,
sometimes, when this happens no seeds result. At other times
the seeds appear, but they are less healthy and vigorous than
those which are the outcome of <i>cross-fertilization</i>—the term
used by botanists to describe the quickening of the ovules in one
blossom by the pollen from another.</p>

<p class='c004'>But perhaps we hardly realize the importance of abundant
health and vigor in a plant’s offspring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us suppose that our eyes are so keen as to enable us to
note the different seeds which, during one summer, seek to secure
a foothold in some few square inches of the sheltered roadside.
The neighboring herb Roberts and jewel-weeds discharge—catapult
fashion—several small invaders into the very heart of the
little territory. A battalion of silky-tufted seeds from the
cracked pods of the milkweed float downward and take lazy
possession of the soil, while the heavy rains wash into their immediate
vicinity those of the violet from the overhanging bank.
The hooked fruit of the stick-tight is finally brushed from the
hair of some exasperated animal by the jagged branches of the
neighboring thicket and is deposited on the disputed ground,
while a bird passing just overhead drops earthward the seed of
the partridge berry. The ammunition of the witch-hazel, too,
is shot into the midst of this growing colony; to say nothing of
a myriad more little squatters that are wafted or washed or
dropped or flung upon this one bit of earth, which is thus transformed
into a bloodless battle-ground, and which is incapable of
yielding nourishment to one-half or one-tenth or even one hundredth
of these tiny strugglers for life!</p>

<p class='c004'>So, to avoid diminishing the vigor of their progeny by <i>self-fertilization</i>
(the reverse of cross-fertilization), various species
take various precautions. In one species the pistil is so placed
that the pollen of the neighboring stamens cannot reach it. In
others one of these two organs ripens before the other, with
the result that the contact of the pollen with the stigma of the
pistil would be ineffectual. Often the stamens and pistils are
in different flowers, sometimes on different plants. But these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>pistils must, if possible, receive the necessary pollen in some way
and fulfil their destiny by setting seed. And we have been
shown that frequently it is brought to them by insects, occasionally
by birds, and that sometimes it is blown to them by
the winds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ingenious devices are resorted to in order to secure these
desirable results. Many flowers make themselves useful to the
insect world by secreting somewhere within their dainty cups
little glands of honey, or, more properly speaking, nectar, for
honey is the result of the bees’ work. This nectar is highly
prized by the insects and is, in many cases, the only object
which attracts them to the flowers, although sometimes the pollen,
which Darwin believes to have been the only inducement offered
formerly, is sought as well.</p>

<p class='c004'>But of course this nectar fails to induce visits unless the bee’s
attention is first attracted to the blossom, and it is tempted to
explore the premises; and we now observe the interesting fact
that those flowers which depend upon insect-agency for their
pollen, usually advertise their whereabouts by wearing bright
colors or by exhaling fragrance. It will also be noticed that
a flower sufficiently conspicuous to arrest attention by its appearance
alone is rarely fragrant.</p>

<p class='c004'>When, attracted by either of these significant characteristics,—color
or fragrance,—the bee alights upon the blossom, it is sometimes
guided to the very spot where the nectar lies hidden by
markings of some vivid color. Thrusting its head into the heart
of the flower for the purpose of extracting the secreted treasure,
it unconsciously strikes the stamens with sufficient force to cause
them to powder its body with pollen. Soon it flies away to
another plant <i>of the same kind</i>, where, in repeating the process
just described, it unwittingly brushes some of the pollen from
the first blossom upon the pistil of the second, where it helps to
make new seeds. Thus these busy bees which hum so restlessly
through the long summer days are working better than they
know and are accomplishing more important feats than the mere
honey-making which we usually associate with their ceaseless
activity.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Those flowers which are dependent upon night-flying insects
for their pollen, contrive to make themselves noticeable
by wearing white or pale yellow,—red, blue, and pink being with
difficulty detected in the darkness. They, too, frequently indicate
their presence by exhaling perfume, which in many
cases increases in intensity as the night falls, and a clue to
their whereabouts becomes momentarily more necessary. This
fact partially accounts for the large proportion of fragrant
white flowers. Darwin found that the proportion of sweet-scented
white flowers to sweet-scented red ones was 14.6 per
cent. of white to 8.2 of red.</p>

<p class='c004'>We notice also that some of these night-fertilized flowers
close during the day, thus insuring themselves against the visits
of insects which might rob them of their nectar or pollen, and
yet be unfitted by the shape of their bodies to accomplish their
fertilization. On the other hand, many blossoms which are
dependent upon the sun-loving bees close at night, securing the
same advantage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then there are flowers which close in the shade, others at
the approach of a storm, thus protecting their pollen and nectar
from the dissolving rain; others at the same time every day.
Linnæus invented a famous “flower-clock,” which indicated
the hours of the day by the closing of different flowers. This
habit of closing has been called the “sleep of flowers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There is one far from pleasing class of flowers which entices
insect-visitors,—not by attractive colors and alluring fragrance—but
“by deceiving flies through their resemblance to putrid
meat—imitating the lurid appearance as well as the noisome
smell of carrion.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Our common carrion-flower, which covers
the thickets so profusely in early summer that Thoreau complained
that every bush and copse near the river emitted an
odor which led one to imagine that all the dead dogs in the
neighborhood had drifted to its shore, is probably an example
of this class, without lurid color, but certainly with a sufficiently
noisome smell! Yet this foul odor seems to answer
the plant’s purpose as well as their delicious aroma does that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>more refined blossoms, if the numberless small flies which it
manages to attract are fitted to successfully transmit its pollen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Certain flowers are obviously adapted to the visits of insects
by their irregular forms. The fringed or otherwise conspicuous
lip and long nectar-bearing spur of many orchids point
to their probable dependence upon insect-agency for perpetuation;
while the papilionaceous blossoms of the Pulse family also
betray interesting adaptations for cross-fertilization by the same
means. Indeed it is believed that irregularity of form is rarely
conspicuous in a blossom that is not visited by insects.</p>

<p class='c004'>The position of a nodding flower, like the harebell, protects
its pollen and nectar from the rain and dew; while the hairs in
the throat of many blossoms answer the same purpose and exclude
useless insects as well.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another class of flowers which calls for special mention is that
which is dependent upon the wind for its pollen. It is interesting
to observe that this group expends little effort in useless
adornment. “The wind bloweth where it listeth” and takes
no note of form or color. So here we find those</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wan flowers without a name,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>which, unheeded, line the wayside. The common plantain of
the country dooryard, from whose long tremulous stamens the
light, dry pollen is easily blown, is a familiar example of this
usually ignored class. Darwin first observed, that “when a
flower is fertilized by the wind it never has a gayly colored corolla.”
Fragrance and nectar as well are usually denied these
sombre blossoms. Such is the occasional economy of that at
times most reckless of all spendthrifts—nature!</p>

<p class='c004'>Some plants—certain violets and the jewel-weeds among
others—bear small inconspicuous blossoms which depend upon
no outside agency for fertilization. These never open, thus effectually
guarding their pollen from the possibility of being
blown away by the wind, dissolved by the rain, or stolen by
insects. They are called <i>cleistogamous</i> flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nature’s clever devices for securing a wide dispersion of
seeds have been already hinted at. One is tempted to dwell at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>length upon the ingenious mechanism of the elastically bursting
capsules of one species, and the deft adjustment of the silky sails
which waft the seeds of others; on the barbed fruits which have
pressed the most unwilling into their prickly service, and the
bright berries which so temptingly invite the hungry winter
birds to peck at them till their precious contents are released,
or to devour them, digesting only the pulpy covering and allowing
the seeds to escape uninjured into the earth at some conveniently
remote spot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then one would like to pause long enough to note the slow
movements of the climbing plants and the uncanny ways of the
insect-devourers. At our very feet lie wonders for whose elucidation
a lifetime would be far too short. Yet if we study for
ourselves the mysteries of the flowers, and, when daunted, seek
their interpretation in those devoted students who have made
this task part of their life-work, we may hope finally to attain at
least a partial insight into those charmed lives which find</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>EXPLANATION OF TERMS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The comprehension of the flower descriptions and of the
opening chapters will be facilitated by the reading of the following
explanation of terms. For words or expressions other
than those which are included in this section, the Index of
Technical Terms at the end of the book should be consulted.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Root</b> of a plant is the part which grows downward into
the ground and absorbs nourishment from the soil. True roots
bear nothing besides root-branches or <b>rootlets</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The <b>Stem</b> is the axis of the plant, the part which bears all
the other organs.” (Gray.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Rootstock</b> is a creeping stem which grows beneath the surface
of the earth. (See Blood-root and Solomon’s Seal. Pls. I.
and X.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Tuber</b> is a thickened end of a rootstock, bearing buds,—“eyes,”—on
its sides. The common Potato is a familiar example
of a tuber, being a portion of the stem of the potato plant.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Corm</b> is a short, thick, fleshy underground stem which
sends off roots from its lower face. (See Jack-in-the-Pulpit,
Pl. CIV.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Bulb</b> is an underground stem, the main body of which
consists of thickened scales, which are in reality leaves or leaf
bases, as in the onion.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Simple Stem</b> is one which does not branch.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Stemless</b> plant is one which bears no obvious stem, but
only leaves and flower-stalks, as in the Common Blue Violet
and Liver-leaf (Pl. LXXXIV.).</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Scape</b> is the leafless flower-stalk of a stemless plant. (See
Liver-leaf (Pl. LXXXIV.).)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>An <b>Entire Leaf</b> is one the edge of which is not cut or lobed
in any way. (See Rhododendron, Pl. XVI., and Closed Gentian,
Pl. C.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Simple Leaf</b> is one which is not divided into leaflets; its
edges may be either lobed or entire. (See Rhododendron, Pl.
XVI.; also Fig. 1.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Compound Leaf</b> is one which is divided into leaflets, as in
the Wild Rose, Pink Clover, and Travellers’ Joy (Pl. XXXI.,
also Fig. 2).</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Much-divided Leaf</b> is one which is several times divided
into leaflets (Fig. 3).</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Axil</b> of a leaf is the upper angle formed by a leaf or leaf-stalk
and the stem.</p>

<p class='c004'>Flowers which grow from the axils of the leaves are said to
be <b>Axillary</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A cluster in which the flowers are arranged—each on its own
stalk—along the sides of a common stem or stalk is called a
<b>Raceme</b>. (See Cardinal-flower, Pl. LXXXIII.; Shin-leaf, Pl.
XVIII.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A cluster in which the flower-stalks all spring from apparently
the same point, as in the Milkweeds, somewhat suggesting
the spreading ribs of an umbrella, is called an <b>Umbel</b> (Pl.
LXXXI.).</p>

<p class='c004'>A cluster which is formed of a number of small umbels, all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the stalks of which start from apparently the same point, is called
a <b>Compound Umbel</b>. (See Wild Carrot, Pl. XXVIII.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A close, circular flower-cluster, like that of Pink Clover or
Dandelion, is called a <b>Head</b>. (See Oswego Tea, Pl. LXXXII.;
Sunflower, Pl. LVII.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A flower-cluster along the lengthened axis of which the
flowers are sessile or closely set is called a <b>Spike</b>. (See Vervain,
Pl. XCII.; Mullein, Pl. LI.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Spadix</b> is a fleshy spike or head, with small and often imperfect
flowers, as in the Jack-in-the-Pulpit, and Skunk Cabbage
(Pls. CII. and CIV., also Fig. 4).</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Spathe</b> is the peculiar leaf-like bract which usually envelopes
a spadix. (See Jack-in-the-Pulpit and Skunk Cabbage,
Pls. CII. and CIV., also Fig. 5.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A leaf or flower which is set so close in the stem as to show
no sign of a separate leaf or flower-stalk, is said to be <b>Sessile</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Complete Flower</b> (Fig. 6) is “that part of a plant which
subserves the purpose of producing seed, consisting of stamens
and pistils, which are the essential organs, and the calyx and
corolla, which are the protecting organs.” (Gray.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The green outer flower-cup, or outer set of green leaves,
which we notice at the base of many flowers, is the <b>Calyx</b> (Fig.
6 Ca). At times this part is brightly colored and may be the
most conspicuous feature of the flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the calyx is divided into separate leaves, these leaves
are called <b>Sepals</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The inner flower-cup or the inner set of leaves is the <b>Corolla</b>
(Fig. 6, C).</p>

<p class='c004'>When the corolla is divided into separate leaves, these leaves
are called <b>Petals</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>We can look upon calyx and corolla as the natural tapestry
which protects the delicate organs of the flower, and serves as
well, in many cases, to attract the attention of passing insects.
In some flowers only one of these two parts is present; in such
a case the single cup or set of floral leaves is generally considered
to be the calyx.</p>

<p class='c004'>The floral leaves may be spoken of collectively as the <b>Perianth</b>.
This word is used especially in describing members of
families where there might be difficulty in deciding as to whether
the single set of floral leaves present should be considered calyx
or corolla (see Lilies, Pls. XLV. and LXXX.); or where the
petals and sepals can only be distinguished with difficulty, as
with the Orchids.</p>

<p>Fig. 8.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Stamens</b> (Fig. 7) are the fertilizing organs of the flower.
A stamen usually consists of two parts, its <b>Filament</b> (F), or stalk,
and its <b>Anther</b> (A), the little sac at the tip of the filament which
produces the dust-like, fertilizing substance called <b>Pollen</b> (p.).</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Pistil</b> (Fig. 8) is the seed-bearing organ of the flower.
When complete it consists of <b>Ovary</b> (O), <b>Style</b> (Sty.), and
<b>Stigma</b> (Stg.).</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Ovary</b> is the hollow portion at the base of the pistil. It
contains the ovules or rudimentary seeds which are quickened
into life by the pollen.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The <b>Style</b> is the slender tapering stalk above the ovary.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Stigma</b> is usually the tip of the style. The pollen-grains
which are deposited upon its moist roughened surface throw out
minute tubes which penetrate to the little ovules of the ovary and
cause them to ripen into seeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>A flower which has neither stamens nor pistils is described as
<b>Neutral</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A flower with only one kind of these organs is termed <b>Unisexual</b>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Male</b> or <b>Staminate</b> flower is one with stamens but without
pistils.</p>

<p class='c004'>A <b>Female</b> or <b>Pistillate</b> flower is one with pistils but without
stamens.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <b>Fruit</b> of a plant is the ripened seed-vessel or seed-vessels,
including the parts which are intimately connected with it or
them.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>NOTABLE PLANT FAMILIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Although the great majority of plant families can only be
distinguished by a combination of characteristics which are too
obscure to obtain any general recognition, there are some few
instances where these family traits are sufficiently conspicuous
to be of great assistance in the ready identification of flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, for instance, we recognize at sight a papilionaceous blossom
and know that such an one only occurs in the Pulse family,
we save the time and energy which might otherwise have been
expended on the comparison of a newly found blossom of this
character with the descriptions of flowers of a different lineage.
Consequently it has seemed wise briefly to describe the marked
features of such important families as generally admit of easy
identification.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Composite Family.</b>—It is fortunate for the amateur botanist
that the plant family which usually secures the quickest recognition
should also be the largest in the world. The members of
the Composite family attract attention in every quarter of the
globe, and make themselves evident from early spring till late
autumn, but more especially with us during the latter season.</p>

<p class='c004'>The most noticeable characteristic of the Composites is the
crowding of a number of small flowers into a close cluster or
<i>head</i>, which head is surrounded by an involucre, and has the
effect of a single blossom. Although this grouping of small
flowers in a head is not peculiar to this tribe, the same thing being
found in the clovers, the milkworts, and in various other
plants—still a little experience will enable one to distinguish a
Composite without any analysis of the separate blossoms which
form the head.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>These heads vary greatly in size and appearance. At times
they are large and solitary, as in the dandelion. Again they
are small and clustered, as in the yarrow (Pl. XXVIII.).</p>

<p class='c004'>In some genera they are composed of flowers which are all
similar in form and color, as in the dandelion, where all the
corollas are <i>strap-shaped</i> and yellow; or, as in the common
thistle, where they are all <i>tubular-shaped</i> and pinkish-purple.</p>

<p class='c004'>In others they are made up of both kinds of flowers, as in
the daisy, where only the yellow central or <i>disk-flowers</i> are tubular-shaped,
while the white outer or <i>ray-flowers</i> are strap-shaped.
The flower-heads of the well-known asters and golden-rods
are composed of both ray and disk-flowers also; but while
the ray-flowers of the aster, like those of the daisy, wear a different
color from the yellow disk-flowers, both kinds are yellow
in the golden-rod.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the dandelion or the chicory (Pl. XCVIII.) is studied as an
example of a head which is composed entirely of strap-shaped blossoms;
the common thistle or the stick-tight (Pl. LVIII.) as an example
of one which is made up of tubular-shaped blossoms; and
the daisy or the sunflower (Pl. LVII.) as an example of one which
combines ray and disk-flowers—as the strap-shaped and tubular
blossoms are called when both are present—there need be little
difficulty in the after recognition of a member of this family.
The identification of a particular species or even genus will be a
less simple matter; the former being a task which has been
known to tax the patience of even advanced botanists.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Grant Allen believes that the Composites largely owe
their universal sway to their “co-operative system.” He says:
“If we look close into the Daisy we see that its centre comprises
a whole mass of little yellow bells, each of which consists
of corolla, stamens, and pistil. The insect which alights on the
head can take his fill in a leisurely way, without moving from
his standing-place; and meanwhile he is proving a good ally of
the plant by fertilizing one after another of its numerous ovaries.
Each tiny bell by itself would prove too inconspicuous to attract
much attention from the passing bee; but union is strength for
the Daisy as for the State, and the little composites have found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>their co-operative system answer so well, that late as was their
appearance upon the earth they are generally considered at the
present day to be the most numerous family both in species and
individuals of all flowering plants.” While those of us who
know the country lanes at that season when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—ranks of seeds their witness bear,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>feel that much of their omnipresence is due to their unsurpassed
facilities for globe-trotting. Our roadsides every autumn
are lined with tall golden-rods, whose brown, velvety clusters
are composed of masses of tiny seeds whose downy sails are set
for their aerial voyage; with asters, whose myriad flower-heads
are transformed into little puff-balls which are awaiting dissolution
by the November winds, and with others of the tribe
whose hooked seeds win a less ethereal but equally effective
transportation.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Parsley Family.</b>—The most familiar representative of the
Parsley family is the wild carrot, which so profusely decks
the highways throughout the summer with its white, lace-like
clusters; while the meadow parsnip is perhaps the best known
of its yellow members.</p>

<p class='c004'>This family can usually be recognized by the arrangement of
its minute flowers in umbels (p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>), which umbels are again so
clustered as to form a compound umbel (Wild Carrot, Pl.
XXVIII.) whose radiating stalks suggest the ribs of an umbrella,
and give this Order its Latin name of <i>Umbelliferæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>A close examination of the tiny flowers which compose these
umbrella-like clusters discovers that each one has five white
or yellow petals, five stamens, and a two-styled pistil. Sometimes
the calyx shows five minute teeth. The leaves are usually
divided into leaflets or segments which are often much toothed
or incised.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Parsleys are largely distinguished from one another by
differences in their fruit, which can only be detected with the
aid of a microscope. It is hoped, however, that the more common
and noticeable species will be recognized by means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>descriptions which give their general appearance, season of
blooming, and favorite haunts.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Pulse Family.</b>—The Pulse family includes many of our common
wood- and field-flowers. The majority of its members are
easily distinguished by those irregular, butterfly-shaped blossoms
which are described as <i>papilionaceous</i>. The sweet pea is a
familiar example of such a flower, and a study of its curious
structure renders easy the after identification of a papilionaceous
blossom, even if it be as small as one of the many which make
up the head of the common pink clover.</p>

<p class='c004'>The calyx of such a flower is of five more or less—and sometimes
unequally—united sepals. The corolla consists of five
irregular petals, the upper one of which is generally wrapped
about the others in bud, while it spreads or turns backward in
flower. This petal is called the <i>standard</i>. The two side petals
are called <i>wings</i>. The two lower ones are usually somewhat
united and form a sort of pouch which encloses the stamens and
style; this is called the <i>keel</i>, from a fancied likeness to the
prow of an ancient vessel. There are usually ten stamens and
one pistil.</p>

<p class='c004'>These flowers are peculiarly adapted to cross-fertilization
through insect agency, although one might imagine the contrary
to be the case from the relative positions of stamens
and pistil. In the pea-blossom, for example, the hairy portion
of the style receives the pollen from the early maturing stamens.
The weight of a visiting bee projects the stigma and the pollen-laden
style against the insect’s body. But it must be observed
that in this action the <i>stigma first brushes against the bee</i>, while
the <i>pollen-laden style touches him later</i>, with the result that the
bee soon flies to another flower on whose fresh stigma the detached
pollen is left, while a new cargo of this valuable material
is unconsciously secured, and the same process is indefinitely repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Mint Family.</b>—A member of the Mint family usually exhales
an aromatic fragrance which aids us to place it correctly. If to
this characteristic is added a square stem, opposite leaves, a two-lipped
corolla, four stamens in pairs—two being longer than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>others—or two stamens only, and a pistil whose style (two-lobed
at the apex) rises from a deeply four-lobed ovary which
splits apart in fruit into four little seed-like nutlets, we may feel
sure that one of the many Mints is before us.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sometimes we think we have encountered one of the family
because we find the opposite leaves, two-lipped corolla, four
stamens, and an ovary that splits into four nutlets in fruit; but
unless the ovary was also deeply four-lobed in the flower, the
plant is probably a Vervain, a tribe which greatly resembles the
Mints. The Figworts, too, might be confused with the Mints
did we not always keep in mind the four-lobed ovary.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this family we find the common catnip and pennyroyal,
the pretty ground ivy, and the handsome bee balm (Pl. LXXXII.).</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Mustard Family.</b>—The Mustard family is one which is
abundantly represented in waste places everywhere by the little
shepherd’s purse or pickpocket, and along the roadsides by the
yellow mustard, wild radish, and winter-cress (Pl. XLII.).</p>

<p class='c004'>Its members may be recognized by their alternate leaves,
their biting harmless juice, and by their white, yellow, or purplish
flowers, the structure of which at once betrays the family to
which they belong.</p>

<p class='c004'>The calyx of these flowers is divided into four sepals. The
four petals are placed opposite each other in pairs, their spreading
blades forming a cross which gives the Order its Latin name
<i>Cruciferæ</i>. There are usually six stamens, two of which are inserted
lower down than the others. The single pistil becomes
in fruit a pod. Many of the Mustards are difficult of identification
without a careful examination of their pods and seeds.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Orchis Family.</b>—To the minds of many the term orchid only
suggests a tropical air-plant, which is rendered conspicuous either
by its beauty or by its unusual and noticeable structure.</p>

<p class='c004'>This impression is, perhaps, partly due to the rude print in
some old text-book which endeared itself to our childish minds
by those startling and extravagant illustrations which are responsible
for so many shattered illusions in later life; and partly
to the various exhibitions of flowers in which only the exotic
members of this family are displayed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Consequently, when the dull clusters of the ragged fringed
orchis, or the muddy racemes of the coral-root, or even the
slender, graceful spires of the ladies’ tresses are brought from
the woods or roadside and exhibited as one of so celebrated a
tribe, they are usually viewed with scornful incredulity, or, if
the authority of the exhibitor be sufficient to conquer disbelief,
with unqualified disappointment. The marvellous mechanism
which is exhibited by the humblest member of the Orchis family,
and which suffices to secure the patient scrutiny and wondering
admiration of the scientist, conveys to the uninitiated as little
of interest or beauty as would a page of Homer in the original
to one without scholarly attainments.</p>

<p class='c004'>The uprooting of a popular theory must be the work of years,
especially when it is impossible to offer as a substitute one
which is equally capable of being tersely defined and readily apprehended;
for many seem to hold it a righteous principle to
cherish even a delusion till it be replaced by a belief which affords
an equal amount of satisfaction. It is simpler to describe
an orchid as a tropical air-plant which apes the appearance of
an insect and never roots in the ground than it is to master by
patient study and observation the various characteristics which
so combine in such a plant as to make it finally recognizable and
describable. Unfortunately, too, the enumeration of these unsensational
details does not appeal to the popular mind, and so
fails to win by its accuracy the place already occupied by the incorrect
but pleasing conception of an orchid.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the benefit of those who wish to be able to correctly place
these curious and interesting flowers, as brief a description as
seems compatible with their recognition is appended.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Leaves.</i>—Alternate, parallel-nerved.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Flowers.</i>—Irregular in form, solitary or clustered, each one
subtended by a bract.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Perianth.</i>—Of six divisions in two sets. The three outer
divisions are sepals, but they are usually petal-like in appearance.
The three inner are petals. By a twist of the ovary what would
otherwise be the upper petal is made the lower. This division is
termed the <i>lip</i>; it is frequently brightly colored or grotesquely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>shaped, being at times deeply fringed or furrowed; it has often
a spur-like appendage which secretes nectar; it is an important
feature of the flower and is apparently designed to attract insects
for the purpose of securing their aid in the cross-fertilization
which is usually necessary for the perpetuation of the different
species of this family, all of which give evidence of great modification
by means of insect-selection.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the heart of the flower is the <i>column</i>; this is usually composed
of the stamen (of two in the <i>Cypripediums</i>), which is confluent
with the <i>style</i> or thick, fleshy <i>stigma</i>. The two <i>cells</i> of
the <i>anther</i> are placed on either side of and somewhat above the
stigma; these cells hold the two pollen masses.</p>

<p class='c004'>Darwin tells us that the flower of an orchid originally consisted
of fifteen different parts, three petals, three sepals, six
stamens, and three pistils. He shows traces of all these parts in
the modern orchid.</p>

<p class='c004'>In early April the firm tip of the curled-up leaf of the blood-root
pushes through the earth and brown leaves, bearing within
its carefully shielded burden—the young erect flower-bud. When
the perils of the way are passed and a safe height is reached this
pale, deeply lobed leaf resigns its precious charge and gradually
unfolds itself; meanwhile the bud slowly swells into a blossom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surely no flower of all the year can vie with this in spotless
beauty. Its very transitoriness enhances its charm. The snowy
petals fall from about their golden centre before one has had
time to grow satiated with their perfection. Unless the rocky
hill-sides and wood-borders are jealously watched it may escape us
altogether. One or two warm sunny days will hasten it to maturity,
and a few more hours of wind and storm shatter its loveliness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Care should be taken in picking the flower—if it must be
picked—as the red liquid which oozes blood-like from the
wounded stem makes a lasting stain. This crimson juice was
prized by the Indians for decorating their faces and tomahawks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even then, search the woods as we may, we shall hardly find
thus early in April another shrub in blossom, unless it be the
spice-bush, whose tiny honey-yellow flowers escape all but the
careful observer. The shad-bush has been thus named because of
its flowering at the season when shad “run;” June-berry, because
the shrub’s crimson fruit surprises us by gleaming from the copses
at the very beginning of summer; service-berry, because of the
use made by the Indians of this fruit, which they gathered in

</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>And in the writings of the ancients as well we could find many
allusions to the same flower were we justified in believing that
the blossom christened the “wind-shaken,” by some poet flower-lover
of early Greece, was identical with our modern anemone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pliny tells us that the anemone of the classics was so entitled
because it opened at the wind’s bidding. The Greek tradition
claims that it sprang from the passionate tears shed by Venus
over the body of the slain Adonis. At one time it was believed
that the wind which had passed over a field of anemones was
poisoned and that disease followed in its wake. Perhaps because
of this superstition the flower was adopted as the emblem of sickness
by the Persians. Surely our delicate blossom is far removed
from any suggestion of disease or unwholesomeness, seeming instead
to hold the very essence of spring and purity in its quivering
cup.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rue Anemone.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Anemonella thalictroides.</i> Crowfoot Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Six to twelve inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into rounded leaflets.

sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—None. <i>Stamens.</i>—Numerous. <i>Pistils.</i>—Four to
fifteen.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rue anemone seems to linger especially about the spreading
roots of old trees. It blossoms with the wood anemone,
from which it differs in bearing its flowers in clusters.</p>

or five. <span class='sc'>Pistil.</span>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finding this delicate flower in the May woods, one is at once
reminded of the anemone. The whole effect of plant, leaf, and
snow-white blossom is starry and pointed. The frosted tapering
petals distinguish it from the rounded blossoms of the wild strawberry,
near which it often grows.</p>

<i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a two-lobed stigma. <i>Fruit.</i>—A red berry.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems unfair that this familiar and pretty little plant should
be without any homely English name. Its botanical title signifies
“Canada Mayflower,” but while it undoubtedly grows in
Canada and flowers in May, the name is not a happy one, for it
abounds as far south as North Carolina, and is not the first blossom
to be entitled “Mayflower.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In late summer the red berries are often found in close proximity
to the fruit of the shin-leaf and pipsissewa.</p>

southward. At Lakewood they appear even before those of the
trailing arbutus which grows in the same localities. The generic

<p class='c004'>“The umbrellas are out!” cry the children, when the great
green leaves of the May-apple first unfold themselves in spring.
These curious-looking leaves at once betray the hiding-place of
the pretty but unpleasantly odoriferous flower which nods beneath
them. They lie thickly along the woods and meadows in
many parts of the country, arresting one’s attention by the
railways. The fruit, which ripens in July, has been given the
name of “wild lemon,” in some places on account of its shape.
It was valued by the Indians for medicinal purposes, and its
mawkish flavor still seems to find favor with the children,
notwithstanding its frequently unpleasant after-effects. The
leaves and roots are poisonous if taken internally, and are said
to have been used as a pot-herb, with fatal results. They yield
an extract which has been utilized in medicine.</p>

To be sure, she is not “hidden in her leaflets,” although often
seeking concealment beneath the leaves of other plants—but
why not assume that Miss Dickinson has availed herself of something

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>We look for the spring beauty in April and May, and often
find it in the same moist places—on a brook’s edge or skirting
the wet woods—as the yellow adder’s tongue. It is sometimes
mistaken for an anemone, but its rose-veined corolla and linear
leaves easily identify it. Parts of the carriage-drive in the Central
Park are bordered with great patches of the dainty blossoms.
One is always glad to discover these children of the country
within our city limits, where they can be known and loved by
those other children who are so unfortunate as to be denied the
knowledge of them in their usual haunts. If the day chances to
be cloudy these flowers close and are only induced to open again
by an abundance of sunlight. This habit of closing in the shade
is common to many flowers, and should be remembered by those
who bring home their treasures from the woods and fields, only
to discard the majority as hopelessly wilted. If any such exhausted
blossoms are placed in the sunlight, with their stems in
fresh water, they will probably regain their vigor. Should this
treatment fail, an application of very hot—almost boiling—water
should be tried. This heroic measure often meets with success.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>There is something singularly fragile and spring-like in the
appearance of this plant as its heart-shaped blossoms nod from
the rocky ledges where they thrive best. One would suppose
that the firmly closed petals guarded against any intrusion on
the part of insect-visitors and indicated the flower’s capacity
for self-fertilization; but it is found that when insects are excluded
by means of gauze no seeds are set, which goes to prove
that the pollen from another flower is a necessary factor in the
continuance of this species. The generic name, <i>Dicentra</i>, is
from the Greek and signifies <i>two-spurred.</i> The flower, when
seen, explains its two English titles. It is accessible to every
New Yorker, for in early April it whitens many of the shaded
ledges in the upper part of the Central Park.</p>

<i>Steinbrech</i>—stonebreak—the Germans appropriately entitle this
little plant, which bursts into bloom from the minute clefts in the

<p class='c004'>When we go to the swampy woods in March or April we
notice an array of green, solid-looking spears which have just appeared
above the ground. If we handle one of these we are impressed
with its firmness and rigidity. When the increasing
warmth and sunshine have tempted the veiny, many-plaited
leaves of the false hellebore to unfold themselves it is difficult to
realize that they composed that sturdy tool which so effectively
tunnelled its way upward to the earth’s surface. The tall stems
and large bright leaves of this plant are very noticeable in the
early year, forming conspicuous masses of foliage while the trees
and shrubs are still almost leafless. The dingy flowers which
appear later rarely attract attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>One whiff of the foul breath of the carrion flower suffices for
its identification. Thoreau likens its odor to that of “a dead
rat in the wall.” It seems unfortunate that this strikingly
handsome plant which clambers so ornamentally over the luxuriant
thickets which border our lanes and streams, should be so
handicapped each June. Happily with the disappearance of the
blossoms, it takes its place as one of the most attractive of our
climbers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common green-brier, <i>S. rotundifolia</i>, is a near relation
which is easily distinguished by its prickly stem.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dark berries and deeply tinted leaves of this genus add
greatly to the glorious autumnal display along our roadsides and
in the woods and meadows.</p>

<p class='c004'>This very beautiful and decorative flower must be sought far
from the highway in the cool rich woods of April and May.
Mr. Ellwanger speaks of the “chaste pure triangles of the white
wood lily,” and says that it often attains a height of nearly two
feet.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>T. cernuum</i> has no English title. Its smaller white or pinkish
blossom is borne on a stalk which is so much curved as to
sometimes quite conceal the flower beneath the leaves. It may
be sought in the moist places in the woods.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The painted trillium, <i>T. erythrocarpum</i>, is also less large and
showy than the great white trillium, but it is quite as pleasing.
Its white petals are painted at their base with red stripes. This
species is very plentiful in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ground-nut. Dwarf Ginseng.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Aralia trifolia.</i> Ginseng Family.</span></h4>

into from three to five leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—White, in an umbel. <i>Fruit.</i>—Yellowish,
berry-like. <i>Root.</i>—A globular tuber.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tiny white flowers of the dwarf ginseng are so closely
clustered as to make “one feathery ball of bloom,” to quote Mr.
Hamilton Gibson. This little plant resembles its larger relative,
the true ginseng. It blossoms in our rich open woods early in
spring, and hides its small round tuber so deep in the earth that
it requires no little care to uproot it without breaking the slender
stem. This tuber is edible and pungent-tasting, giving the plant
its name of ground-nut.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ginseng.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Aralia quinquefolia.</i> Ginseng Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Root.</i>—Large and spindle-shaped, often forked. <i>Stem.</i>—About one foot
high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Three in a whorl, divided into leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Greenish-white,
in a simple umbel. <i>Fruit.</i>—Bright red, berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant is well known by name, but is yearly becoming
more scarce. The aromatic root is so greatly valued in China for
its supposed power of combating fatigue and old age that it can
only be gathered by order of the emperor. The forked specimens
are believed to be the most powerful, and their fancied likeness
to the human form has obtained for the plant the Chinese title
of <i>Jin-chen</i> (from which ginseng is a corruption), and the Indian
one of <i>Garan-toguen</i>, both of which, strangely enough, are said
to signify, <i>like a man</i>. The Canadian Jesuits first began to ship
the roots of the American species to China, where they sold at
about five dollars a pound. At present they are said to command
about one-fifth of that price in the home market.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the June woods the much-divided leaf and rounded
flower-clusters of the wild sarsaparilla are frequently noticed, as
well as the dark berries of the later year. The long aromatic
roots of this plant are sold as a substitute for the genuine sarsaparilla.
The rice-paper plant of China is a member of this

pointed, toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>—White, veined with purple, violet beneath,
otherwise greatly resembling the common blue violet.</p>

<p class='c004'>We associate the violet with the early year, but I have found
the delicate fragrant flowers of this species blossoming high up
on the Catskill Mountains late into September; and have known
them to continue to appear in a New York city-garden into November.
They are among the loveliest of the family, having a
certain sprightly self-assertion which is peculiarly charming,
perhaps because so unexpected.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tiny sweet white violet, <i>V. blanda</i>, with brown or purple
veins, which is found in nearly all low, wet, woody places in
spring, is perhaps the only uniformly fragrant member of the
family, and its scent, though sweet, is faint and elusive.</p>

bell-shaped, nodding from the axils of the leaves. <i>Perianth.</i>—Six-lobed at
the summit. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—A dark blue berry.</p>

<p class='c004'>The graceful leafy stems of the Solomon’s seal are among the
most decorative features of our spring woods. The small blossoms
which appear in May grow either singly or in clusters on a
flower-stalk which is so fastened into the axil of each leaf that
they droop beneath, forming a curve of singular grace which is
sustained in later summer by the dark blue berries.</p>

<p class='c004'>The larger species, <i>P. giganteum</i>, grows to a height of from
two to seven feet, blossoming in the meadows and along the
streams in June.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common name was suggested by the rootstocks, which
are marked with large round scars left by the death and separation
of the base of the stout stalks of the previous years. These
scars somewhat resemble the impression of a seal upon wax.</p>

<p class='c004'>The generic name is from two Greek words signifying

<p class='c004'>This pretty little creeper is found blossoming in May in the

<p class='c004'>A singular lack of imagination is betrayed in the common
name of this plant. Despite a general resemblance to the true
Solomon’s seal, and the close proximity in which the two are
constantly found, <i>S. racemosa</i>, has enough originality to deserve
an individual title. The position of the much smaller flowers is
markedly different. Instead of drooping beneath the stem they
terminate it, having frequently a pleasant fragrance, while the
berries of late summer are pale red, flecked with purple. It puzzles
one to understand why these two plants should so constantly
be found growing side by side—so close at times that they almost
appear to spring from one point. The generic name is
from <i>smilax</i>, on account of a supposed resemblance between the
leaves of this plant and those which belong to that genus.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps our flowering shrubs contribute even more to the
beauty of the early summer woods and fields than the smaller
plants. Along many of the lanes which intersect the woodlands
the viburnums are conspicuous in June. When the blossoms
of the dockmackie have passed away we need not be surprised
if we are informed that this shrub is a young maple. There is
certainly a resemblance between its leaves and those of the maple,
as the specific name indicates. To be sure, the first red, then
purple berries, can scarcely be accounted for, but such a trifling
incongruity would fail to daunt the would-be wiseacre of field
and forest. With Napoleonic audacity he will give you the name
of almost any shrub or flower about which you may inquire.
Seizing upon some feature he has observed in another plant, he
will immediately christen the one in question with the same title—somewhat
modified, perhaps—and in all probability his authority

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hobble-bush. American Wayfaring-tree.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Viburnum lantanoides.</i> Honeysuckle Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Leaves.</i>—Rounded, pointed, closely toothed, heart-shaped at the base,
the veins beneath as well as the stalks and small branches being covered
with a rusty scurf. <i>Fruit.</i>—Coral-red, berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The marginal flowers of the flat-topped clusters of the hobble-bush,
like those of the hydrangea, are much larger than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>inner ones, and are without either stamens or pistils; their only
part in the economy of the shrub being to form an attractive
setting for the cluster, and thus to allure the insect-visitors that
are usually so necessary to the future well-being of the species.
The shrub is a common one in our northern woods and mountains.
Its straggling growth, and its reclining branches, which
often take root in the ground, have suggested the popular
names of hobble-bush, and wayfaring-tree.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Round-leaved Dogwood.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Cornus circinata.</i> Dogwood Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A shrub six to ten feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Rounded, abruptly pointed.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Small, white, in flat, spreading clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>—Minutely four-toothed.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Of four white, oblong, spreading petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four.
<i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—Light blue, berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The different members of the Dogwood family are important
factors in the lovely pageant which delights our eyes along the
country lanes every spring. Oddly enough, only the smallest
and largest representative of the tribe (the little bunch-berry,
and the flowering-dogwood, which is sometimes a tree of goodly
dimensions), have in common the showy involucre which is
usually taken for the blossom itself; but which instead only surrounds
the close cluster of inconspicuous greenish flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other members of the genus are all comprised in the
shrubby dogwoods; many of these are very similar in appearance,
bearing their white flowers in flat, spreading clusters,
and differing chiefly in their leaves and fruit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The branches of the round-leaved dogwood are greenish
and warty-dotted. Its fruit is light blue, and berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The panicled dogwood, <i>C. paniculata</i>, may be distinguished
by its white fruit and smooth, gray branches.</p>

<p class='c004'>The red-osier dogwood, <i>C. stolonifera</i>, is common in wet
places. Its young shoots and branches are a bright purplish-red.
Its flower-clusters are small; its fruit, white or lead-color.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bark of this genus has been considered a powerful tonic,
and an extract entitled “cornine,” is said to possess the properties
of quinine less strongly marked. The Chinese peel its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>twigs, and use them for whitening their teeth. It is said that
the Creoles also owe the dazzling beauty of their teeth to this
same practice.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bellwort.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Oakesia sessilifolia.</i> Lily Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Acutely angled, rather low. <i>Leaves.</i>—Set close to or clasping
the stem, pale, lance-oblong. <i>Flower.</i>—Yellowish-white or straw-color.
<i>Perianth.</i>—Narrowly bell-shaped, divided into six distinct sepals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six.
<i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a deeply three-cleft style.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spring this little plant is very abundant in the woods. It
bears one or two small lily-like blossoms which droop modestly
beneath the curving stems.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the same common name and near of kin is <i>Uvularia
perfoliata</i>, with leaves which seem pierced by the stem, but
otherwise of a strikingly similar aspect.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hawthorn. White-thorn.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Cratægus coccinea.</i> Rose Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A shrub or small tree, with spreading branches, and stout thorns or
spines. <i>Leaves.</i>—On slender leaf-stalks, thin, rounded, toothed, sometimes
lobed. <i>Flowers.</i>—White or sometimes reddish, rather large, clustered, with
a somewhat disagreeable odor. <i>Calyx.</i>—Urn-shaped, five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of
five broad, rounded petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five to ten, or many. <i>Pistil.</i>—One,
with one to five styles. <i>Fruit.</i>—Coral-red, berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of the white-thorn appear in spring, at the same
time with those of the dogwoods. Its scarlet fruit gleams from
the thicket in September.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>White Baneberry.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Actæa alba.</i> Crowfoot Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—About two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Twice or thrice-compound, leaflets
incised and sharply toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>—Small, white, in a thick, oblong,
terminal raceme. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of four to five tiny sepals which fall as the
flower expands. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of four to ten small flat petals with slender
claws. <i>Stamens.</i>—Numerous, with slender white filaments. <i>Pistil.</i>—One,
with a depressed, two-lobed stigma. <i>Fruit.</i>—An oval white berry, with a
dark spot, on a <i>thick red stalk</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The feathery clusters of the white baneberry may be gathered
when we go to the woods for the columbine, the wild ginger,
the Jack-in-the-pulpit, and Solomon’s seal. These flowers are
very nearly contemporaneous and seek the same cool shaded
nooks, all often being found within a few feet of one another.</p>

<p class='c004'>The red baneberry, <i>A. rubra</i>, is a somewhat more Northern
plant and usually blossoms a week or two earlier. Its cherry-red
(occasionally white) berries on their <i>slender stalks</i> are easily distinguished
from the white ones of <i>A. alba</i>, which look strikingly
like the china eyes that small children occasionally manage to
gouge from their dolls’ heads.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mountain Holly.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Nemopanthes fascicularis.</i> Holly Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A much branched shrub, with ash-gray bark. <i>Leaves.</i>—Alternate, oblong,
smooth, on slender leaf-stalks. <i>Flowers.</i>—White, some perfect,
others unisexual; solitary or clustered in the axils of the leaves on long,
slender flower-stalks. <i>Calyx.</i>—Minute or obsolete. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of four or
five spreading petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four or five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—Coral-red,
berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of this shrub appear in the damp woods of May.
Its light red berries on their slender stalks are noticed in late
summer when its near relation, the black alder or winterberry
is also conspicuous. Its generic name signifies <i>flower with a
thread-like stalk</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Winterberry. Black Alder.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Ilex verticillata.</i> Holly Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A shrub, common in low grounds. <i>Leaves.</i>—Oval or lance-shaped,
pointed at apex and base, toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>—White; some perfect,
others unisexual; clustered on very short flower-stalks in the axils of the
leaves; appearing in May or June. <i>Calyx.</i>—Minute. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of four
to six petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four to six. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—Coral-red,
berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>The year may draw nearly to its close without our attention
being arrested by this shrub. But in September it is well nigh
impossible to stroll through the country lanes without pausing
to admire the bright red berries clustered so thickly among the
leaves of the black alder. The American holly, <i>I. opaca</i>, is
closely related to this shrub, whose generic name is the ancient
Latin title for the holly-oak.</p>

<p class='c004'>The white clusters of the red-berried elder are found in the

appearing in June.</p>

crowded into an apparent whorl of four to six. <i>Flowers.</i>—Greenish, small,
in a cluster which is surrounded by a large and showy four-leaved, petal-like,
white or pinkish involucre. <i>Calyx.</i>—Minutely four-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of
four spreading petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—Bright
red, berry-like.</p>

<p class='c004'>When one’s eye first falls upon the pretty flowers of the
bunch-berry in the June woods, the impression is received that
each low stem bears upon its summit a single large white blossom.
A more searching look discovers that what appeared like rounded
petals are really the showy white leaves of the involucre which
surround the small, closely clustered, greenish flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bright red berries which appear in late summer make
brilliant patches in the woods and swamps. Both in flower and
fruit this is one of the prettiest of our smaller plants. It is
closely allied to the well-known flowering-dogwood, which is so
ornamental a tree in early spring.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the Scotch Highlands it is called the “plant of gluttony,”
on account of its supposed power of increasing the appetite.
It is said to form part of the winter food of the Esquimaux.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nodding, fragrant spikes of the lizard’s tail abound in

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Mountain Laurel. Spoonwood. Calico-bush.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Kalmia latifolia.</i> Heath Family.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>An evergreen shrub. <i>Leaves.</i>—Oblong, pointed, shining, of a leathery
texture. <i>Flowers.</i>—White or pink, in terminal clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-parted.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Marked with red, wheel-shaped, five-lobed, with ten depressions.
<i>Stamens.</i>—Ten, each anther lodged in one of the depressions of
the corolla. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The shining green leaves which surround the white or rose-colored
flowers of the mountain laurel are familiar to all who have
skirted the west shore of the Hudson River, wandered across
the hills that lie in its vicinity, or clambered across the mountains
of Pennsylvania, where the shrub sometimes grows to a
height of thirty feet. Not that these localities limit its range:
for it abounds more or less from Canada to Florida, and far inland,
especially along the mountains, whose sides are often
clothed with an apparent mantle of pink snow during the month
of June, and whose waste places are, in very truth, made to blossom
like the rose at this season.</p>

<p class='c004'>The shrub is highly prized and carefully cultivated in England.
Barewood Gardens, the beautiful home of the editor of
the London <i>Times</i>, is celebrated for its fine specimens of mountain
laurel and American rhododendron. The English papers
advertise the approach of the flowering season, the estate is
thrown open to the public, and the people for miles around flock
to see the radiant strangers from across the water. The shrub is
not known there as the laurel, but by its generic title, <i>Kalmia</i>.
The head gardener of the place received with some incredulity
my statement that in parts of America the waste hill-sides were
brilliant with its beauty every June.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ingenious contrivance of these flowers to secure cross-fertilization
is most interesting. The long filaments of the stamens
are arched by each anther being caught in a little pouch of
the corolla; the disturbance caused by the sudden alighting of
an insect on the blossom, or the quick brush of a bee’s wing,
dislodges the anthers from their niches, and the stamens spring
upward with such violence that the pollen is jerked from its hiding-place
in the pore of the anther-cell on to the body of the insect-visitor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>who straightway carries it off to another flower upon whose
protruding stigma it is sure to be inadvertently deposited. In
order to see the working of this for one’s self, it is only necessary
to pick a fresh blossom and either brush the corolla quickly with
one’s finger, or touch the stamens suddenly with a pin, when
the anthers will be dislodged and the pollen will be seen to fly.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is not the laurel of the ancients—the symbol of victory
and fame—notwithstanding some resemblance in the form of the
leaves. The classic shrub is supposed to be identical with the
<i>Laurus nobilis</i> which was carried to our country by the early
colonists, but which did not thrive in its new environment.</p>

<p class='c004'>The leaves of our species are supposed to possess poisonous
qualities, and are said to have been used by the Indians for suicidal
purposes. There is also a popular belief that the flesh of a
partridge which has fed upon its fruit becomes poisonous. The
clammy exudation about the flower-stalks and blossoms may
serve the purpose of excluding from the flower such small insects
as would otherwise crawl up to it, dislodge the stamens, scatter
the pollen, and yet be unable to carry it to its proper destination
on the pistil of another flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Kalmia</i> was named by Linnæus after Peter Kalm, one of
his pupils who travelled in this country, who was, perhaps, the
first to make known the shrub to his great master.</p>

<p class='c004'>The popular name spoonwood grew from its use by the Indians
for making eating-utensils. The wood is of fine grain and
takes a good polish.</p>

<p class='c004'>The title calico-bush probably arose from the marking of the
corolla, which, to an imaginative mind, might suggest the cheap
cotton-prints sold in the shops.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>White Swamp Honeysuckle. Clammy Azalea.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Rhododendron viscosum.</i> Heath Family.</span></h4>

clustered, appearing after the leaves. <i>Calyx-lobes.</i>—Minute. <i>Corolla.</i>—White,
five-lobed, the clammy tube much longer than the lobes.

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The fragrant white flowers of this beautiful shrub appear in
early summer along the swamps which skirt the coast, and occasionally
farther inland. The close family resemblance to the pink
azalea (Pl. LXV.) will be at once detected. On the branches
of both species will be found those abnormal, fleshy growths,
called variously “swamp apples” and “May apples,” which
are so relished by the children. Formerly these growths were
attributed to the sting of an insect, as in the “oak apple;”
now they are generally believed to be modified buds.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>American Rhododendron. Great Laurel.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Rhododendron maximum.</i> Heath Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A shrub from six to thirty-five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Thick and leathery,
oblong, entire. <i>Flowers.</i>—White or pink, clustered. <i>Calyx.</i>—Minute,
five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>—Somewhat bell-shaped, five-parted, greenish in the
throat, with red, yellow, or green spots. <i>Stamens.</i>—Usually ten. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>This beautiful native shrub is one of the glories of our country
when in the perfection of its loveliness. The woods which
nearly cover many of the mountains of our Eastern States hide
from all but the bold explorer a radiant display during the early
part of July. Then the lovely waxy flower-clusters of the American
rhododendron are in their fulness of beauty. As in the
laurel, the clammy flower-stalks seem fitted to protect the blossom
from the depredations of small and useless insects, while the
markings on the corolla attract the attention of the desirable bee.</p>

<p class='c004'>In those parts of the country where it flourishes most luxuriantly,
veritable rhododendron jungles termed “hells” by the
mountaineers are formed. The branches reach out and interlace
in such a fashion as to be almost impassable.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nectar secreted by the blossoms is popularly supposed to
be poisonous. We read in Xenophon that during the retreat
of the Ten Thousand, the soldiers found a quantity of honey of
which they freely partook, with results that proved almost fatal.
This honey is said to have been made from a rhododendron
which is still common in Asia Minor and which is believed to
possess intoxicating and poisonous properties.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surely nowhere can be found a daintier carpeting than that

with its rose-veined blossoms in the northern woods of June.
At the very name comes a vision of mossy nooks where the sunlight
only comes on sufferance, piercing its difficult path through
the tent-like foliage of the forest, resting only long enough to become
a golden memory.</p>

<p class='c004'>The early Italian painters availed themselves of its chaste
beauty. Mr. Ruskin says: “Fra Angelico’s use of the <i>Oxalis
Acetosella</i> is as faithful in representation as touching in feeling.
The triple leaf of the plant and white flower stained purple
probably gave it strange typical interest among the Christian
painters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Throughout Europe it bears the odd name of “Hallelujah”
on account of its flowering between Easter and Whitsuntide, the
season when the Psalms sung in the churches resound with that
word. There has been an unfounded theory that this title sprang
from St. Patrick’s endeavor to prove to his rude audience the
possibility of a Trinity in Unity from the three-divided leaves.
By many this ternate leaf has been considered the shamrock of
the ancient Irish.</p>

<p class='c004'>The English title, “cuckoo-bread,” refers to the appearance
of the blossoms at the season when the cry of the cuckoo is first
heard.</p>

<p class='c004'>The poison sumach infests swampy places and flowers in

like to decorate our homes with its brilliant sprays, but are deterred
from handling them by the fear of being poisoned, not
knowing that one glance at the crimson fruit-plumes should reassure
us, as the poisonous sumachs are white-fruited. These
tossing pyramidal fruit-clusters at first appear to explain the
common title of staghorn sumach. It is not till the foliage has
disappeared, and the forked branches are displayed in all their
nakedness, that we feel that these must be the feature in which
the common name originated.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>A shrub which usually climbs by means of rootlets over rocks, walls, and
trees; sometimes low and erect. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into three somewhat
four-sided pointed leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Greenish or yellowish-white, small,
some perfect, others unisexual; in loose clusters in the axils of the leaves in
June. <i>Fruit.</i>—Small, globular, somewhat berry-like, dun-colored, clustered.</p>

<p class='c004'>This much-dreaded plant is often confused with the beautiful
Virginia creeper, occasionally to the ruthless destruction of the
latter. Generally the two can be distinguished by the three-divided
leaves of the poison ivy, the leaves of the Virginia
creeper usually being five-divided. In the late year the whitish
fruit of the ivy easily identifies it, the berries of the creeper being
blackish. The poison ivy is reputed to be especially harmful
during the night, or at any time in early summer when the sun
is not shining upon it.</p>

rootlets. <i>Leaves.</i>—Usually divided into five leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Greenish,
small, clustered, appearing in July. <i>Fruit.</i>—A small, blackish berry in October.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surely in autumn, if not always, this is the most beautiful of
our native climbers. At that season its blood-like sprays are outlined
against the dark evergreens about which they delight to
twine, showing that marvellous discrimination in background
which so constantly excites our admiration in nature. The Virginia
creeper is extensively cultivated in Europe. Even in
Venice, that sea-city where one so little anticipates any reminders
of home woods and meadows, many a dim canal mirrors
in October some crumbling wall or graceful trellis aglow
with its vivid beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the distance these pretty flowers suggest the lilies-of-the-valley.
They are found in the woods of June and July,
often in close company with the pipsissewa. The ugly common
name of shin-leaf arose from an early custom of applying the
leaves of this genus to bruises or sores; the English peasantry
being in the habit of calling any kind of plaster a “shin-plaster”
without regard to the part of the body to which it might be
applied. The old herbalist, Salmon, says that the name <i>Pyrola</i>
was given to the genus by the Romans on account of the fancied
resemblance of its leaves and flowers to those of a pear-tree.
The English also call the plant “wintergreen,” which name we
usually reserve for <i>Gaultheria procumbens</i>.</p>

chance upon great patches of these deliciously fragrant and pretty
flowers. The little plant, with its shining evergreen foliage,
flourishes abundantly among decaying leaves in sandy soil, and
puts forth its dainty blossoms late in June. It is one of the latest
of the fragile wood-flowers which are so charming in the earlier
year, and which have already begun to surrender in favor of
their hardier, more self-assertive brethren of the fields and roadsides.
The common name, pipsissewa, is evidently of Indian
origin, and perhaps refers to the strengthening properties which
the red men ascribed to it.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the summer months the fields and waysides are whitened

small white daisies or asters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another common species is <i>E. strigosus</i>, a smaller plant, with
smaller flower-heads also, but with the white ray-flowers longer.
The generic name is from two Greek words signifying <i>spring</i>
and <i>an old man</i>, in allusion to the hoariness of certain species
which flower in the spring. The fleabanes were so named from
the belief that when burned they were objectionable to insects.
They were formerly hung in country cottages for the purpose of
excluding such unpleasant intruders.</p>

counterpart of the common daisy do they appear that they are
constantly mistaken for that flower. The smaller heads, with
the yellow disk-flowers crowded upon a receptacle which is much
more conical than that of the daisy, and the finely dissected,
feathery leaves, serve to identify the Mayweed. The country-folk
brew “chamomile tea” from these leaves, and through
their agency raise painfully effective blisters in an emergency.</p>

sometimes used as a substitute for tea. The bright red berries
are also edible and savory, and are much appreciated by the
hungry birds and deer during the winter. If not thus consumed

five-rayed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>The effect of a cluster of these nodding, wax-like flowers in
the deep woods of summer is singularly fairy-like. They spring
from a ball of matted rootlets, and are parasitic, drawing their
nourishment from decaying vegetable matter. In fruit the plant
erects itself and loses its striking resemblance to a pipe. Its
clammy touch, and its disposition to decompose and turn black

<p class='c004'>This insignificant and ordinarily uninteresting plant arrests
attention by the frequency with which it is found flowering in
the summer woods and along shady roadsides.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>C. Alpina</i> is a smaller, less common species, which is found
along the mountains and in deep woods. Both species are burdened
with the singularly inappropriate name of enchanter’s
nightshade. There is nothing in their appearance to suggest an
enchanter or any of the nightshades. It seems, however, that
the name of a plant called after the enchantress Circe, and described
by Dioscorides nearly two thousand years ago, was accidentally
transferred to this unpretentious genus.</p>

<p class='c004'>These greenish flowers, which may be found in the woods and

<p class='c004'>This plant may be found in wooded or shady places throughout
the continent. Its flowers, which appear in summer, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>rather inconspicuous, one’s attention being chiefly attracted by

<p class='c004'>The small flowers of the bitter-sweet, which appear in June,
rarely attract attention. But in October no lover of color can
fail to admire the deep orange pods which at last curl back so as
advantageously to display the brilliant scarlet covering of the
seeds. Perhaps we have no fruit which illuminates more vividly
the roadside thicket of late autumn; or touches with greater
warmth those tumbled, overgrown walls which are so picturesque
a feature in parts of the country, and do in a small way for our
quiet landscapes what vine-covered ruins accomplish for the scenery
of the Old World.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tall straight stems of the culver’s root lift their slender
spikes in midsummer to a height that seems strangely at variance
with the habit of this genus. The small flowers, however, at
once betray their kinship with the speedwells. Although it is,
perhaps, a little late to look for the white wands of the black
cohosh the two plants might easily be confused in the distance,
as they have much the same aspect and seek alike the cool recesses
of the woods. This same species grows in Japan and was
introduced into English gardens nearly two hundred years ago.
It is one of the many Indian remedies which were adopted by
our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tall white wands of the black cohosh shoot up in the
shadowy woods of midsummer like so many ghosts. A curious-looking
plant it is, bearing aloft the feathery flowers which have
such an unpleasant odor that even the insects are supposed to
avoid them. Fortunately they are sufficiently conspicuous to be
admired at a distance, many a newly cleared hill-side and wood-border
being lightened by their slender, torch-like racemes which
flash upon us as we travel through the country. The plant was
one of the many which the Indians believed to be efficacious for
snake-bites. The generic name is from <i>cimex</i>—a bug, and <i>fugare</i>—to

<p class='c004'>The common elder borders the lanes and streams with its
spreading flower-clusters in early summer, and in the later year
is noticeable for the dark berries from which “elderberry wine”
is brewed by the country people. The fine white wood is easily
cut and is used for skewers and pegs. A decoction of the leaves
serves the gardener a good purpose in protecting delicate plants
from caterpillars. Evelyn wrote of it: “If the medicinal properties
of the leaves, berries, bark, etc., were thoroughly known,
I cannot tell what our countrymen could ail for which he might
not fetch from every hedge, whether from sickness or wound.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The white pith can easily be removed from the stems, hence
the old English name of bore-wood.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Two or three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Ovate, lance-shaped or linear.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Clustered within the usually five-lobed, cup-shaped involucre
which was formerly considered the flower itself; the male flowers numerous
and lining its base, consisting each of a single stamen; the female flower
solitary in the middle of the involucre, consisting of a three-lobed ovary
with three styles, each style being two-cleft. <i>Pod.</i>—On a slender stalk,
smooth.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this plant the showy white appendages of the cup-shaped
clustered involucres are usually taken for the petals of the flower;
only the botanist suspecting that the minute organs within these
involucres really form a cluster of separate flowers of different
sexes. While the most northerly range in the Eastern States of
this spurge is usually considered to be New York, the botany
states that it has been recently naturalized in Massachusetts. It
blossoms from July till October.</p>

<i>Pistil.</i>—One, its ovary united with that of its sister flower, its
four stigmas linear.</p>

<p class='c004'>At all times of the year this little plant faithfully fulfils its
mission of adorning that small portion of the earth to which it
finds itself rooted. But only the early summer finds the partridge
vine exhaling its delicious fragrance from the delicate sister-blossoms
which are its glory. Among the waxy flowers will be
found as many of the bright red berries of the previous year as
have been left unmolested by the hungry winter birds. This
plant is found not only in the moist woods of North America,
but also in the forests of Mexico and Japan. It is a near relative
of the dainty bluets or Quaker ladies, and has the same peculiarity
of dimorphous flowers (p. <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>).</p>

by a week or more. The lip of the ragged fringed is three-parted,
the divisions being deeply fringed, giving what is called
in Sweet’s “British Flower-Garden” an “elegantly jagged appearance.”
The lip of the green orchis is furnished with a tooth
on each side and a strong protuberance in the middle. So far
as superficial beauty and conspicuousness are concerned these
flowers do scant justice to the brilliant family to which they belong,
and equally excite the scornful exclamation, “You call

<p class='c004'>This pretty shrub borders the streams and swamps throughout

<p class='c004'>The common knotweed, <i>P. aviculare</i>, which grows in such
abundance in country dooryards and waste places, has slender,
often prostrate, stems, and small greenish flowers, which are clustered
in the axils of the leaves or spiked at the termination of
the stems. This is perhaps the “hindering knotgrass” to which
Shakespeare refers in the “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” so
terming it, not on account of its knotted trailing stems, but because
of the belief that it would hinder the growth of a child. In
Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Coxcomb” the same superstition is
indicated:</p>

<p class='c004'>In early summer this plant, which clambers so perseveringly
over the moist thickets which line our country lanes, is comparatively
inconspicuous. The racemes of small greenish flowers are
not calculated to attract one’s attention, and it is late summer or
autumn before the thick clusters of greenish fruit composed of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>winged seed-vessels arrest one’s notice. At this time the vine is
very beautiful and striking, and one wonders that it could have

<p class='c004'>The foliage of this pretty little plant suggests the violet;
while its white blossom betrays its kinship with the wild strawberry.
It may be found from June till August in woody places,
being one of those flowers which we seek deliberately, whose
charm is never decreased by its being thrust upon us inopportunely.
Who can tell how much the attractiveness of the wild
carrot, the dandelion, or butter-and-eggs would be enhanced
were they so discreet as to withdraw from the common haunts of
men into the shady exclusiveness which causes us to prize many

<p class='c004'>In late July many of our wooded banks are decorated with
the tall stems, whorled leaves, and prettily fringed flowers of the
starry campion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Closely allied to it is the bladder campion of the fields, <i>S.
Cucubalus</i>, a much smaller plant, with opposite leaves, loosely
clustered white flowers, a greatly inflated calyx, and two-cleft
petals. This is an emigrant from Europe, which was first naturalized
near Boston, and has now become wild in different parts
of the country, quite overrunning some of the farm-lands which
border the Hudson River.</p>

rue, the feathery, graceful flower-clusters of which erect themselves
serenely above the myriad blossoms which are making
radiant the wet meadows at this season. For here, too, we
may search for the purple flag and fringed orchis, the yellow

The staminate flowers of this plant are especially delicate and

<p class='c004'>The white avens is one of the less noticeable plants which

<p class='c004'>The feathery spires of the meadow-sweet soar upward from
the river banks and low meadows in late July. Unlike its pink
sister, the steeple-bush, its leaves and stems are fairly smooth.
The lack of fragrance in the flowers is disappointing, because of
the hopes raised by the plant’s common name. This is said by
Dr. Prior to be a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon <i>mead-wort</i>,
which signifies <i>honey-wine herb</i>, alluding to a fact which is mentioned
in Hill’s “Herbal,” that “the flowers mixed with mead
give it the flavor of the Greek wines.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This exquisite flower calls for little description. Many of us
are so fortunate as to hold in our memories golden mornings devoted
to its quest. We can hardly take the shortest railway
journey in summer without passing some shadowy pool whose
greatest adornment is this spotless and queenly blossom. The
breath of the lily-pond is brought even into the heart of our cities

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>In the water-lily may be seen an example of so-called <i>plant-metamorphosis</i>.
The petals appear to pass gradually into stamens,
it being difficult to decide where the petals end and the
stamens begin. But whether stamens are transformed petals, or
petals transformed stamens seems to be a mooted question. In
Gray we read, “Petals numerous, in many rows, the innermost
gradually passing into stamens,” while Mr. Grant Allen writes:
“Petals are in all probability enlarged and flattened stamens,
which have been set apart for the work of attracting insects,”
and goes on to say, “Flowers can and do exist without petals,&#160;... but no flower can possibly exist without stamens, which
are one of the two essential reproductive organs in the plant.”
From this he argues that it is more rational to consider a petal a
transformed stamen than <i>vice versa.</i> To go further into the subject
here would be impossible, but a careful study of the water-lily
is likely to excite one’s curiosity in the matter.</p>

of the shock which attends the shattered illusion, their charm is
only increased by the new sense of kinship.</p>

<p class='c004'>The round-leaved sundew is found blossoming in many of
our marshes in midsummer. When the sun shines upon its
leaves they look as though covered with sparkling dewdrops,
hence its common name. These drops are a glutinous exudation,
by means of which insects visiting the plant are first captured;
the reddish bristles then close tightly about them, and it
is supposed that their juices are absorbed by the plant. At all
events the rash visitor rarely escapes. In many localities it is
easy to secure any number of these little plants and to try for
one’s self the rather grewsome experiment of feeding them with
small insects. Should the tender-hearted recoil from such reckless
slaughter, they might confine their offerings on the altar of
science to mosquitoes, small spiders, and other deservedly unpopular

<p class='c004'>There is a vigor about this native plant which is very pleasing.
In July it is possible that we barely notice the white flowers
and large leaves; but when in September the tall purple
stems rear themselves above their neighbors in the roadside
thicket, the leaves look as though stained with wine, and the
long clusters of rich dark berries hang heavily from the branches,
we cannot but admire its independent beauty. The berries serve
as food for the birds. A tincture of them at one time acquired
some reputation as a remedy for rheumatism. In Pennsylvania
they have been used with whiskey to make a so-called “portwine.”
From their dark juice arose the name of “red-ink
plant,” which is common in some places. The large roots are
poisonous, but the acrid young shoots are rendered harmless by
boiling, and are eaten like asparagus, being quite as good, I have
been told by country people.</p>

<p class='c004'>Despite the difference in the spelling of the names, it has
been suggested that the plant was called after President Polk.
This is most improbable, as it was common throughout the
country long before his birth, and its twigs are said to have been
plucked and worn by his followers during his campaign for the
Presidency.</p>

The fringed lips give the snowy, delicate flowers a feathery appearance

spire upward from among the dark green rushes which border
some lonely mountain lake. Like the yellow fringed orchis (Pl.

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>This is one of our most frequent roadside weeds, blossoming
throughout the summer and late into the autumn. Tradition claims
that it was used by Achilles to cure the wounds of his soldiers,
and the genus is named after that mighty hero. It still forms
one of the ingredients of an ointment valued by the Scotch Highlanders.
The early English botanists called the plant “nosebleed,”
“because the leaves being put into the nose caused it to
bleed;” and Gerarde writes that “Most men say that the leaves
chewed, and especially greene, are a remedie for the toothache.”
These same pungent leaves also won it the name of “old man’s
pepper,” while in Sweden its title signifies <i>field hop</i>, and refers
to its employment in the manufacture of beer. Linnæus
considered the beer thus brewed to be more intoxicating than
that in which hops were utilized. The old women of the Orkney
Islands hold “milfoil tea” in high repute, believing it to be
gifted with the power of dispelling melancholy. In Switzerland
a good vinegar is said to be made from the Alpine species.
The plant is cultivated in the gardens of Madeira, where so
many beautiful, and in our eyes rare, flowers grow in wild
profusion.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Wild Carrot. Bird’s Nest. Queen Anne’s Lace.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Daucus carota.</i> Parsley Family (p. <a href='#Page_15'>15</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stems.</i>—Tall and slender. <i>Leaves.</i>—Finely dissected. <i>Flowers.</i>—White,
in a compound umbel, forming a circular flat-topped cluster.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the delicate flowers of the wild carrot are still unsoiled
by the dust from the highway, and fresh from the early summer
rains, they are very beautiful, adding much to the appearance of
the roadsides and fields along which they grow so abundantly as
to strike despair into the heart of the farmer, for this is, perhaps,
the “peskiest” of all the weeds with which he has to contend.
As time goes on the blossoms begin to have a careworn
look and lose something of the cobwebby aspect which won them
the title of Queen Anne’s lace. In late summer the flower-stalks
erect themselves, forming a concave cluster which has the
appearance of a bird’s nest. I have read that a species of bee
makes use of this ready-made home, but have never seen any indications
of such an occupancy.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is believed to be the stock from which the garden carrot
was raised. The vegetable was well known to the ancients, and
we learn from Pliny that the finest specimens were brought to
Rome from Candia. When it was first introduced into Great
Britain is not known, although the supposition is that it was
brought over by the Dutch during the reign of Elizabeth. In
the writings of Parkinson we read that the ladies wore carrot-leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in their hair in place of feathers. One can picture the
dejected appearance of a ball-room belle at the close of an entertainment.</p>

<i>Leaves.</i>—Twice or thrice-compound, leaflets coarsely toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>—White,
in compound umbels, the little umbels composed of numerous flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant is often confused with the wild carrot, the sweet
Cicely, and other white-flowered members of the Parsley family;
but it can usually be identified by its purple-streaked stem. The
umbels of the water-hemlock are also more loosely clustered than
those of the carrot, and their stalks are much more unequal. It
is commonly found in marshy ground, blossoming in midsummer.
Its popular names refer to its poisonous properties, its root being
said to contain the most dangerous vegetable-poison native to our
country and to have been frequently confounded with that of the
edible sweet Cicely with fatal results.</p>

<i>Leaves.</i>—Dissected into fine, thread-like divisions. <i>Flowers.</i>—White, very
small, growing in compound umbels with thread-like bracts.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant blossoms all summer in wet meadows, both inland
and along the coast; but it is especially common in the salt marshes
near New York City. It probably owes its English name
to the fancied resemblance between the bracted flower-clusters
and a bishop’s cap. Its effect is feathery and delicate.</p>

<p class='c004'>The roots of the sweet Cicely are prized by country children
for their pleasant flavor. Great care should be taken not to confound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>this plant with the water-hemlock, which is very poisonous,
and which it greatly resembles, although flowering earlier in the
year. The generic name is from two Greek words which signify
<i>scent</i> and <i>root</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant is found growing in water or wet places throughout
North America.</p>

three sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of three white, rounded petals. <i>Stamens and
Pistils.</i>—Indefinite in number, occurring in different flowers, the lower whorls
of flowers usually being pistillate, the upper staminate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among our water-flowers none are more delicately lovely than
those of the arrow-head. Fortunately the ugly and inconspicuous
female flowers grow on the lower whorls, while the male
ones, with their snowy petals and golden centres, are arranged
about the upper part of the scape, where the eye first falls. It is
a pleasure to chance upon a slow stream whose margins are bordered
with these fragile blossoms and bright, arrow-shaped leaves.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Water-plantain.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Alisma Plantago.</i> Water-plantain Family.</span></h4>

rounded or heart-shaped at base. <i>Flowers.</i>—White or pale pink, small,
in large, loose clusters which branch from the scape. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of three sepals.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Of three petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Usually six. <i>Pistils.</i>—Many,

yellowish-white, solitary on nodding flower-stalks. <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-cleft; enlarging
and much inflated in fruit, loosely enclosing the berry. <i>Corolla.</i>—Between
wheel-shaped and funnel-form. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five, erect, with yellow
anthers. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—A green or yellow edible berry which
is loosely enveloped in the much-inflated calyx.</p>

<p class='c004'>We find the ground cherry in light sandy soil, and are more

the rather inconspicuous flowers which appear in summer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Turtle-head.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Chelone glabra.</i> Figwort Family.</span></h4>

in a spike or close cluster. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of five sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Two-lipped,
the upper lip broad and arched, notched at the apex, lower lip three-lobed at
the apex, woolly bearded in the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four perfect ones, with
woolly filaments and very woolly, heart-shaped anthers, and one small sterile
one. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems to have been my fate to find the flowers which the
botany relegates to “dry, sandy soil” flourishing luxuriantly in
marshes; and to encounter the flowers which by rights belong
to “wet woods” flaunting themselves in sunny meadows. This
cannot be attributed to the natural depravity of inanimate objects,
for what is more full of life than the flowers?—and no one
would believe in their depravity except perhaps the amateur botanist
who is endeavoring to master the different species of
golden-rods and asters. Therefore it is pleasant to record that
I do not remember ever having met a turtle-head, which is assigned
by the botany to “wet places,” which had not gotten
as close to a stream or a marsh or a moist ditch as it well could
without actually wetting its feet. The flowers of this plant are
more odd and striking than pretty. Their appearance is such
that their common name seems fairly appropriate. I have heard
unbotanical people call them “white closed gentians.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Late in the summer we are perhaps tempted deep into some
thicket by the jasmine-scented heads of the button-bush or the
fragrant spikes of the clethra, and note for the first time the tangled
golden threads and close white flower-clusters of the dodder.
If we try to trace to their source these twisted stems, which the
Creoles know as “angels’ hair,” we discover that they are
fastened to the bark of the shrub or plant about which they are
twining by means of small suckers; but nowhere can we find any
connection with the earth, all their nourishment being extracted
from the plant to which they are adhering. Originally this curious
herb sprang from the ground which succored it until it succeeded
in attaching itself to some plant; having accomplished
this it severed all connection with mother-earth by the withering
away or snapping off of the stem below.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flax-dodder, <i>C. Epilinum</i>, is a very injurious plant in
European flax-fields. It has been sparingly introduced into this
country with flax-seed.</p>

<i>Corolla.</i>—None. <i>Stamens and Pistils.</i>—Indefinite in number, occurring
on different plants.</p>

<p class='c004'>In July and August this beautiful plant, covered with its white
blossoms and clambering over the shrubs which border the country
lanes, makes indeed a fitting bower for any maid or traveller
who may chance to be seeking shelter. Later in the year the
seeds with their silvery plumes give a feathery effect which is
very striking.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>This graceful climber works its way by means of its bending
or clasping leaf-stalks. Darwin has made interesting experiments

He discovered that, “one revolved describing a broad

<p class='c004'>Nearly all our flowering shrubs are past their glory by midsummer,
when the fragrant blossoms of the sweet pepperbush begin
to exhale their perfume from the cool thickets which line the
lanes along the New England coast. There is a certain luxuriance
in the vegetation of this part of the country in August
which is generally lacking farther inland, where the fairer flowers
have passed away, and the country begins to show the effects
of the long days of heat and drought. The moisture of the air,
and the peculiar character of the soil near the sea, are responsible
for the freshness and beauty of many of the late flowers which
we find in such a locality.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Clethra</i> is the ancient Greek name for the alder, which this
plant somewhat resembles in foliage.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Thorn-apple. Jamestown Weed.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Datura Stramonium.</i> Nightshade Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c004'>The showy white flowers of the thorn-apple are found in waste
places during the summer and autumn, a heap of rubbish forming
their usual unattractive background. The plant is a rank,
ill-scented one, which was introduced into our country from Asia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>It was so associated with civilization as to be called the “white
man’s plant” by the Indians.</p>

<p class='c004'>Its purple-flowered relative, <i>D. Tatula</i>, is an emigrant from

small clusters or solitary. <i>Fruit.</i>—Fleshy, oval, green, about two inches
long, clothed with weak prickles.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is an ornamental climber which is found bearing its
flowers and fruit at the same time. It grows in rich soil along
rivers in parts of New England, Pennsylvania, and westward;
and is often cultivated in gardens, making an effective arbor-vine.

<p class='c004'>The slender zigzag stems, thin, coarsely toothed, heart-shaped
leaves, and white, loosely clustered flower-heads of <i>A.

be identified by its long tapering leaves and large, flat flower-clusters.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>A beautiful and abundant seaside species is <i>A. multiflorus</i>.
Its small flower-heads are closely crowded on the low, bushy,
spreading branches; its leaves are narrow, rigid, crowded, and

<p class='c004'>To one whose childhood was passed in the country some
fifty years ago the name or sight of this plant is fraught with
unpleasant memories. The attic or wood-shed was hung with
bunches of the dried herb which served as so many grewsome
warnings against wet feet, or any over-exposure which might
result in cold or malaria. A certain Nemesis, in the shape of a
nauseous draught which was poured down the throat under the
name of “boneset tea,” attended such a catastrophe. The Indians
first discovered its virtues, and named the plant ague-weed.
Possibly this is one of the few herbs whose efficacy has not been
over-rated. Dr. Millspaugh says: “It is prominently adapted to
cure a disease peculiar to the South, known as break-bone fever
(Dengue), and it is without doubt from this property that the
name boneset was derived.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This pretty little orchid is found in great abundance in September
and October. The botany relegates it to “wet places,”
but I have seen dry upland pastures as well as low-lying swamps
profusely flecked with its slender, fragrant spikes. The braided
appearance of these spikes would easily account for the popular
name of ladies’ tresses; but we learn that the plant’s English
name was formerly “ladies’ <i>traces</i>,” from a fancied resemblance
between its twisted clusters and the lacings which played so important
a part in the feminine toilet. I am told that in parts of
New England the country people have christened the plant “wild
hyacinth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of <i>S. gracilis</i> are very small, and grow in a much

marshes which lie back of the beach, we may spy in the distance
a thicket which looks as though composed of such white-flowered
shrubs as belong to June. Hastening to the spot we discover
that the silky-tufted seeds of the female groundsel tree are responsible
for our surprise. The shrub is much more noticeable
and effective at this season than when—a few weeks previous—it
was covered with its small white or yellowish flower-heads.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Gerarde indignantly declares that this plant has been described
by blind men, not “such as are blinde in their eyes, but
in their understandings, for if this plant be a kind of grasse then
may the Butter-burre or Colte’s-foote be reckoned for grasses—as
also all other plants whatsoever.” But if it covered Parnassus
with its delicate veiny blossoms as abundantly as it does some
moist New England meadows each autumn, the ancients may
have reasoned that a plant almost as common as grass must somehow
partake of its nature. The slender-stemmed, creamy flowers
are never seen to better advantage than when disputing with
the fringed gentian the possession of some luxurious swamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>This species is common throughout our Northern woods and
pastures, blossoming in August. Thoreau writes of it in September:
“The pearly everlasting is an interesting white at present.
Though the stems and leaves are still green, it is dry and
unwithering like an artificial flower; its white, flexuous stem and
branches, too, like wire wound with cotton. Neither is there
any scent to betray it. Its amaranthine quality is instead of
high color. Its very brown centre now affects me as a fresh and
original color. It monopolizes small circles in the midst of
sweet fern, perchance, on a dry hill-side.”</p>

border our springs and gladden our wet meadows every April.

marigold—<i>Calendula</i>—but surely no cultivated flower could harmonize
with the spirit of the song as do these gleaming swamp
blossoms. We will yield to the garden if necessary—</p>

lovelier garden in which we all feel a certain sense of possession—even
if we are not taxed on real estate in any part of the country—the
“golden eyes” of the Mary-buds, and we feel strengthened
in our position by the statement in Mr. Robinson’s “Wild
Garden” that the marsh marigold is so abundant along certain
English rivers as to cause the ground to look as though paved
with gold at those seasons when they overflow their banks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>These flowers are peddled about our streets every spring
under the name of cowslips—a title to which they have no claim,
and which is the result of that reckless fashion of christening unrecognized
flowers which is so prevalent, and which is responsible
for so much confusion about their English names.</p>

<p class='c004'>The derivation of marigold is somewhat obscure. In the
“Grete Herball” of the sixteenth century the flower is spoken
of as <i>Mary Gowles</i>, and by the early English poets as <i>gold</i> simply.
As the first part of the word might be derived from the
Anglo-Saxon <i>mere</i>—a marsh, it seems possible that the entire
name may signify <i>marsh-gold</i>, which would be an appropriate
and poetic title for this shining flower of the marshes.</p>

<p class='c004'>These are among the very earliest blossoms to be found in
the moist woods of spring. During the Revolution the powdered

We direct our steps toward one of those hollows in the wood
which is watered by such a clear gurgling brook as must appeal
to every country-loving heart; and there where the pale April
sunlight filters through the leafless branches, nod myriads of
these lilies, each one guarded by a pair of mottled, erect, sentinel-like
leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The two English names of this plant are unsatisfactory and
inappropriate. If the marking of its leaves resembles the skin of
an adder why name it after its tongue? And there is equally
little reason for calling a lily a violet. Mr. Burroughs has suggested
two pretty and significant names. “Fawn lily,” he
thinks, would be appropriate, because a fawn is also mottled, and
because the two leaves stand up with the alert, startled look of
a fawn’s ears. The speckled foliage and perhaps its flowering
season are indicated in the title “trout-lily,” which has a
spring-like flavor not without charm. It is said that the early
settlers of Pennsylvania named the flower “yellow snowdrop,”
in memory of their own “harbinger-of-spring.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The white adder’s tongue, <i>E. albidum</i>, is a species which is
usually found somewhat westward.</p>

<p class='c004'>The name of celandine must always suggest the poet who
never seemed to weary of writing in its honor:</p>

<p class='c013'>And when certain yellow flowers which frequent the village roadside
are pointed out to us as those of the celandine, we feel a
sense of disappointment that the favorite theme of Wordsworth
should arouse within us so little enthusiasm. So perhaps we are
rather relieved than otherwise to realize that the botanical name
of this plant signifies <i>greater</i> celandine; for we remember that
the poet never failed to specify the <i>small</i> celandine as the object
of his praise. The small celandine is <i>Ranunculus ficaria</i>, one
of the Crowfoot family, and is only found in this country as an
escape from gardens.</p>

Both of the English names refer to the pretty foliage, cinquefoil

the following May or June, when we shall probably find that
a slender scape rises from its midst bearing at its summit several
bell-shaped flowers, which, without either high color or fragrance,
are peculiarly charming. It is hard to understand why this
beautiful plant has received no English name. As to its generic
title we cannot but sympathize with Thoreau. “Gray should
not have named it from the Governor of New York,” he complains;
“what is he to the lovers of flowers in Massachusetts?
If named after a man, it must be a man of flowers....
Name your canals and railroads after Clinton, if you please, but

was formerly considered a variety, of the later year.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tall, stout, common wild parsnip, <i>Pastinaca sativa</i>, is
another yellow representative of this family in which white
flowers prevail, the three plants here mentioned being the only
yellow species commonly encountered. The common parsnip may
be identified by its grooved stem and simply compound leaves.
Its roots have been utilized for food at least since the reign of
Tiberius, for Pliny tells us that that Emperor brought them to
Rome from the banks of the Rhine, where they were successfully
cultivated.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Golden Club.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Orontium aquaticum.</i> Arum Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Scape.</i>—Slender, elongated. <i>Leaves.</i>—Long-stalked, oblong, floating.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Small, yellow, crowded over the narrow spike or spadix.</p>

<p class='c004'>When we go to the bogs in May to hunt for the purple flower
of the pitcher-plant we are likely to chance upon the well-named
golden club. This curious-looking club-shaped object, which is
found along the borders of ponds, indicates its relationship to the
jack-in-the-pulpit, and still more to the calla lily, but unlike
them its tiny flowers are shielded by no protecting spathe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Kalm tells us in his “Travels,” “that the Indians called the
plant <i>Taw-Kee</i>, and used its dried seeds as food.”</p>

toothed, contracted into a half-clasping leaf-stalk. <i>Flowers.</i>—Bright yellow,
solitary or clustered. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of five sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of five to
seven oblong petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Indefinite in number, occasionally few.
<i>Pistils.</i>—Numerous in a head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many weeks after the marsh marigolds have passed away, just
such marshy places as they affected are brightly flecked with gold.
Wondering, perhaps, if they can be flowering for the second
time in the season, we wade recklessly into the bog to rescue,
not the marsh marigold, but its near relation, the spearwort,
which is still more closely related to the buttercup, as a little
comparison of the two flowers will show. This plant is especially
common at the North.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Indian Cucumber-root.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Medeola Virginica.</i> Lily Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Root.</i>—Tuberous, shaped somewhat like a cucumber, with a suggestion
of its flavor. <i>Stem.</i>—Slender, from one to three feet high, at first clothed
with wool. <i>Leaves.</i>—In two whorls on the flowering plants, the lower of
five to nine oblong, pointed leaves set close to the stem, the upper usually of
three or four much smaller ones. <i>Flowers.</i>—Greenish-yellow, small, clustered,
recurved, set close to the upper leaves. <i>Perianth.</i>—Of three sepals
and three petals, oblong and alike. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six, reddish-brown. <i>Pistil.</i>—With
three stigmas, long, recurved, and reddish-brown. <i>Fruit.</i>—A
purple berry.</p>

<p class='c004'>One is more apt to pause in September to note the brilliant
foliage and purple berries of this little plant than to gather the
drooping inconspicuous blossoms for his bunch of wood-flowers
in June. The generic name is after the sorceress Medea, on account
of its supposed medicinal virtues, of which, however, there
seems to be no record.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tuberous rootstock has the flavor, and something the
shape, of the cucumber, and was probably used as food by the
Indians. It would not be an uninteresting study to discover
which of our common wild plants are able to afford pleasant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>nutritious food; in such a pursuit many of the otherwise unattractive
popular names would prove suggestive.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Common Bladderwort.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Utricularia vulgaris.</i> Bladderwort Family.</span></h4>

hair-like, bearing numerous bladders. <i>Scape.</i>—Six to twelve inches long.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Yellow, five to twelve on each scape. <i>Calyx.</i>—Two-lipped.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Two-lipped, spurred at the base. <i>Stamens.</i>—Two. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>This curious water-plant may or may not have roots; in
either case it is not fastened to the ground, but is floated by
means of the many bladders which are borne on its finely
dissected leaves. It is commonly found in ponds and slow
streams, flowering throughout the summer. Thoreau calls it “a
dirty-conditioned flower, like a sluttish woman with a gaudy
yellow bonnet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The horned bladderwort, <i>U. cornuta</i>, roots in the peat-bogs
and sandy swamps. Its large yellow helmet-shaped flowers are
very fragrant, less than half a dozen being borne on each scape.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Yellow Pond-lily. Spatter Dock.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Nuphar advena.</i> Water-lily Family.</span></h4>

base. <i>Flowers.</i>—Yellow, sometimes purplish, large, somewhat globular.
<i>Calyx.</i>—Of five or six sepals or more, yellow or green without. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of
numerous small, thick, fleshy petals which are shorter than the stamens
and resemble them. <i>Stamens.</i>—Very numerous. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a
disk-like, many-rayed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bordering the slow streams and stagnant ponds from May
till August may be seen the yellow pond-lilies. These flowers
lack the delicate beauty and fragrance of the white water-lilies;
having, indeed, either from their odor, or appearance, or the form
of their fruit, won for themselves in England the unpoetic title
of “brandy-bottle.” Owing to their love of mud they have
also been called “frog-lilies.” The Indians used their roots
for food.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many are familiar with the appearance of this plant who are
ignorant of its name. The pale yellow flowers spring from the
waste places along the roadside and border the dry fields throughout
the summer. The tall spreading branches recall the biblical
description: “It groweth up, and becometh greater than all
herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the
air may lodge under the shadow of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant is extensively cultivated in Europe, its ground

<p class='c004'>The flowers of <i>K. amplexicaulis</i> appear later, and their

making a sort of flat rosette, usually conspicuously veined with purple.
<i>Flower-heads.</i>—Yellow, composed entirely of strap-shaped flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The loosely clustered yellow flower-heads of the rattlesnake-weed
somewhat resemble small dandelions. They abound in the
pine-woods and dry, waste places of early summer. The purple-veined
leaves, whose curious markings give to the plant its common
name, grow close to the ground and are supposed to be efficacious
in rattlesnake bites. Here again crops out the old
“doctrine of signatures,” for undoubtedly this virtue has been
attributed to the species solely on account of the fancied resemblance
between its leaves and the markings of the rattlesnake.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>If Emerson’s definition of a weed, as a plant whose virtues
have not yet been discovered, be correct, we can hardly place the
dandelion in that category, for its young sprouts have been valued
as a pot-herb, its fresh leaves enjoyed as a salad, and its
dried roots used as a substitute for coffee in various countries and
ages. It is said that the Apache Indians so greatly relish it as
food, that they scour the country for many days in order to procure
enough to appease their appetites, and that the quantity
consumed by one individual exceeds belief. The feathery-tufted
seeds which form the downy balls beloved as “clocks” by country
children, are delicately and beautifully adapted to dissemination
by the wind, which ingenious arrangement partly accounts
for the plant’s wide range. The common name is a corruption
of the French <i>dent de lion</i>. There is a difference of opinion
as to which part of the plant is supposed to resemble a lion’s
tooth. Some fancy the jagged leaves gave rise to the name,
while others claim that it refers to the yellow flowers, which they
liken to the golden teeth of the heraldic lion. In nearly every
European country the plant bears a name of similar signification.</p>

<i>Calyx.</i>—Of five sepals, the two outer much smaller. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of five petals.
<i>Stamens.</i>—Nine to thirty. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a long and slender style.</p>

<p class='c004'>In early summer many of the sand-hills along the New England
coast are bright with the yellow flowers of this hoary little
shrub. It is also found as far south as Maryland and near the
Great Lakes. Each blossom endures for a single day only. The
plant’s popular name is due to its economical habit of utilizing
sandy unproductive soil where little else will flourish.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>This pretty little shrub is found along our rocky hills and
mountains. The blossoms appear in early summer, and form a
good example of nectar-bearing flowers. The lower lobe of
the corolla is crested and more deeply colored than the others,
thus advising the bee of secreted treasure. The hairy filaments
of the stamens are so placed as to protect the nectar from injury
by rain. When the blossom has been despoiled and at the
same time fertilized, for the nectar-seeking bee has probably
deposited some pollen upon its pistil, the color of the corolla
changes from a pale to a deep yellow, thus giving warning to
the insect world that further attentions would be useless to
both parties.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the open woods, from June until September, we encounter
the pale yellow flowers of this rather insignificant little plant.
The cow wheat was formerly cultivated by the Dutch as food
for cattle. The Spanish name, <i>Trigo de Vaca</i>, would seem to
indicate a similar custom in Spain. The generic name, <i>Melampyrum</i>,
is from the Greek, and signifies <i>black wheat</i>, in reference
to the appearance of the seeds of some species when mixed
with grain. The flower would not be likely to attract one’s
attention were it not exceedingly common in some parts of the
country, flourishing especially in our more eastern woodlands.</p>

their base. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six, with anthers loaded with brown pollen. <i>Pistil.</i>—One,
with a three-lobed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>What does the summer bring which is more enchanting than

charm of their own. “Fairy-caps,” these pointed blossoms are
sometimes called; “witch-caps,” would be more appropriate
still. Indeed they would make dainty headgear for any of the
dim inhabitants of Wonder-Land.</p>

<p class='c004'>The growth of this plant is very striking when seen at its
best. The erect stem is surrounded with regular whorls of leaves,
from the upper one of which curves a circle of long-stemmed,

a small pear, often with prickles over its surface.</p>

<p class='c004'>This curious-looking plant is one of the only two representatives
of the Cactus family in the Northeastern States. It has
deep green, fleshy, prickly, rounded joints and large yellow
flowers, which are often conspicuous in summer in dry, sandy
places along the coast.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>O. vulgaris</i>, the only other species found in Northeastern

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>This slender pretty plant grows along the roadsides and attracts
one’s notice in June by its regular whorls of leaves and
flowers. Linnæus says that this genus is named after Lysimachus,
King of Sicily. Loosestrife is the English for Lysimachus;
but whether the ancient superstition that the placing
of these flowers upon the yokes of oxen rendered the beasts
gentle and submissive arose from the peace-suggestive title or
from other causes, I cannot discover.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Yellow Loosestrife.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Lysimachia stricta.</i> Primrose Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c019'>The yellow loosestrife bears its flowers, which are similar to
those of <i>L. quadrifolia</i>, in a terminal raceme; it has opposite
lance-shaped leaves. Its bright yellow clusters border the
streams and brighten the marshes from June till August.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rock-rose. Frost-weed.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Helianthemum Canadense.</i> Rock-rose Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>About one foot high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Set close to the stem, simple, lance-oblong.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Of two kinds: the earlier, more noticeable ones,
yellow, solitary, about one inch across; the later ones small and clustered,
usually without petals. <i>Calyx.</i>—(Of the petal-bearing flowers) of five
sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of five early falling petals which are crumpled in the
bud. <i>Stamens.</i>—Numerous. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a three-lobed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>These fragile bright yellow flowers are found in gravelly
places in early summer. Under the influence of the sunshine
they open once; by the next day their petals have fallen, and
their brief beauty is a thing of the past. On June 17th Thoreau
finds this “broad, cup-like flower, one of the most delicate yellow
flowers, with large spring-yellow petals, and its stamens laid one
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the Vale of Sharon a nearly allied rose-colored species
abounds. This is believed by some of the botanists who have
travelled in that region to be the Rose of Sharon which Solomon
has celebrated.</p>

<p class='c004'>The name of frost-weed has been given to our plant because
of the crystals of ice which shoot from the cracked bark at the
base of the stem in late autumn.</p>

black in drying. <i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, yellow, clustered in many
short, loose racemes.</p>

<p class='c004'>This rather bushy-looking, bright-flowered plant is constantly
encountered in our rambles throughout the somewhat dry
and sandy parts of the country in midsummer. It is said that it
is found in nearly every State in the Union, and that it has been
used as a homœopathic remedy for typhoid fever. Its young
shoots are eaten at times in place of asparagus. Both the botanical
and common names refer to its having yielded an economical
but unsuccessful substitute for indigo.</p>

<i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, yellow, small, in close heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although this little plant is found in such abundance along
our New England roadsides and in many other parts of the
country as well, comparatively few people seem to recognize it
as a member of the clover group, despite a marked likeness in
the leaves and blossoms to others of the same family.</p>

<p class='c004'>The name clover probably originated in the Latin <i>clava</i>-clubs,
in reference to the fancied resemblance between the three-pronged
club of Hercules and the clover leaf. The clubs of our
playing-cards and the <i>trèfle</i> (trefoil) of the French are probably
an imitation of the same leaf.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nonesuch, <i>Medicago lupulina</i>, with downy, procumbent
stems, and flowers which grow in short spikes, is nearly allied to
the hop clover. In its reputed superiority as fodder its English
name is said to have originated. Dr. Prior says that for many
years this plant has been recognized in Ireland as the true shamrock.</p>

<p class='c018'>A shrubby plant from one to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Lance-shaped.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, yellow, growing in spiked racemes.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is another foreigner which has established itself in Eastern
New York and Massachusetts, where it covers the barren
hill-sides with its yellow flowers in early summer. It is a common
English plant, formerly valued for the yellow dye which it
yielded. It is an undesirable intruder in pasture-lands, as it gives
a bitter taste to the milk of cows which feed upon it.</p>

toothed leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, yellow, growing in spike-like
racemes.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plant is often found blossoming along the roadsides in
early summer. It was formerly called in England “king’s-clover,”
because, as Parkinson writes, “the yellowe flowers doe
crown the top of the stalkes.” The leaves become fragrant in
drying.</p>

<i>Calyx.</i>—Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>—Pale yellow tipped with orange,
long-spurred, two-lipped, closed in the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bright blossoms of butter-and-eggs grow in full, close
clusters which enliven the waste places along the roadside so
commonly, that little attention is paid to these beautiful and conspicuous
flowers. They would be considered a “pest” if they did
not display great discrimination in their choice of locality, usually
selecting otherwise useless pieces of ground. The common
name of butter-and-eggs is unusually appropriate, for the two
shades of yellow match perfectly their namesakes. Like nearly all
our common weeds, this plant has been utilized in various ways by
the country people. It yielded what was considered at one time
a valuable skin lotion, while its juice mingled with milk constitutes
a fly-poison. Its generic name, <i>Linaria</i>, and its English
title, toadflax, arose from a fancied resemblance between its leaves
and those of the flax.</p>

<i>Stamens.</i>—Five to ten, unequal, some of them often imperfect. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.
<i>Pod.</i>—Long and narrow, slightly curved, flat.</p>

<p class='c004'>This tall, striking plant, with clusters of yellow flowers which
appear in midsummer, grows abundantly along many of the New
England roadsides, and also far south and west, thriving best in
sandy soil. Although a member of the Pulse family its blossoms
are not papilionaceous.</p>

and showy, on slender stalks beneath the spreading leaves; not papilionaceous.

somewhat unequal petals, two or three of which are usually spotted at the
base with red or purple. <i>Stamens.</i>—Ten, unequal, dissimilar. <i>Pistil.</i>—One,
with a slender style. <i>Pod.</i>—Flat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The partridge-pea is closely related to the wild senna, and a
pretty, delicate plant it is, with graceful foliage, and flowers in
late summer which surprise us with their size, abounding in
gravelly, sandy places where little else will flourish, brightening
the railway embankments and the road’s edge. It is at home all
over the country south of Massachusetts and east of the Rocky
Mountains, but it grows with a greater vigor and luxuriance in
the south than elsewhere. The leaves can hardly be called sensitive
to the touch, yet when a branch is snapped from the
parent-stem or is much handled, the delicate leaflets will droop
and fold, displaying their curious mechanism.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Too well known as a pernicious weed which it is difficult
to extirpate,” is the scornful notice which the botany gives to
this plant whose bright yellow flowers are noticeable in waste
fields and along roadsides nearly all summer. Its rank, rapid
growth proves very exhausting to the soil, and every New England
farmer wishes it had remained where it rightfully belongs—on
the other side of the water.</p>

than about any other plant on record. It was formerly
gathered on St. John’s eve, and was hung at the doors and windows
as a safeguard against thunder and evil spirits. A belief
prevailed that on this night the soul had power to leave the body

<p class='c004'>In early times poets and physicians alike extolled its properties.
An ointment was made of its blossoms, and one of its early
names was “balm-of-the-warrior’s-wound.” It was considered
so efficacious a remedy for melancholia that it was termed “fuga
dæmonum.” Very possibly this name gave rise to the general
idea that it was powerful in dispelling evil spirits.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The common mullein is a native of the island of Thapsos,
from which it takes its specific name. It was probably brought
to this country from Europe by the early colonists, notwithstanding
the title of “American velvet plant,” which it is rumored
to bear in England. The Romans called it “candelaria,” from
their custom of dipping the long dried stalk in suet and using it
as a funeral torch, and the Greeks utilized the leaves for lamp-wicks.
In more modern times they have served as a remedy for
the pulmonary complaints of men and beasts alike, “mullein tea”
being greatly esteemed by country people. Its especial efficacy
with cattle has earned the plant its name of “bullocks’ lungwort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A low rosette of woolly leaves is all that can be seen of the
mullein during its first year, the yellow blossoms on their long
spikes opening sluggishly about the middle of the second summer.
It abounds throughout our dry, rolling meadows, and its
tall spires are a familiar feature in the summer landscape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Along the highway from July till October one encounters a
slender weed on whose erect stem it would seem as though a
number of canary-yellow or purplish-white moths had alighted
for a moment’s rest. These are the fragile, pretty flowers of the
moth mullein, and they are worthy of a closer examination. The
reddened or purplish centre of the corolla suggests the probability
of hidden nectar, while the pretty tufts of violet wool borne
by the stamens are well fitted to protect it from the rain. A
little experience of the canny ways of these innocent-looking
flowers lead one to ask the wherefore of every new feature.</p>

fringed lips, will repay a close examination. They are well calculated,
massed in such brilliant clusters, to arrest the attention
of whatever insects may specially affect them. Although I have
watched many of these plants I have never seen an insect visit
one, and am inclined to think that they are fertilized by night
moths.</p>

<p class='c004'>These beautiful plants are found along shaded streams and
marshes, and are profusely hung with brilliant jewel-like flowers
during the summer months. In the later year they bear those
closed inconspicuous blossoms which fertilize in the bud and are
called cleistogamous flowers. The jewel-weed has begun to appear
along the English rivers, and it is said that the ordinary
showy blossoms are comparatively rare, while the cleistogamous
ones abound. Does not this look almost like a determination on
the part of the plant to secure a firm foothold in its new environment
before expending its energy on flowers which, though
radiant and attractive, are quite dependent on insect-visitors for
fertilization and perpetuation?</p>

<p class='c004'>Along the roadsides in midsummer we notice a tall, rank-growing
plant, which seems chiefly to bear buds and faded blossoms.
And unless we are already familiar with the owl-like tendencies
of the evening primrose, we are surprised, some dim
twilight, to find this same plant resplendent with a mass of fragile
yellow flowers, which are exhaling their faint delicious fragrance
on the evening air.</p>

<p class='c004'>One brief summer night exhausts the vitality of these delicate
blossoms. The faded petals of the following day might serve as
a text for a homily against all-night dissipation, did we not
know that by its strange habit the evening primrose guards
against the depredations of those myriad insects abroad during
the day, which are unfitted to transmit its pollen to the pistil of
another flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are impressed by the utilitarianism in vogue in this floral

so vividly through the darkness as to advertise effectively their
whereabouts, while their fragrance serves as a mute invitation

the long days of blazing sunlight, and are veritable salamanders
among the flowers. Although now so common in our eastern

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>A common and noticeable species which flowers early in
August is <i>S. Canadensis</i>, with a tall stout stem from three to
six feet high, lance-shaped leaves, which are usually sharply
toothed and pointed, and small flower-heads clustered along the
branches which spread from the upper part of the stem.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another early flowering species is <i>S. rugosa</i>. This is a lower
plant than <i>S. Canadensis</i>, with broader leaves. Still another is
the dusty golden-rod, <i>S. nemoralis</i>, which has a hoary aspect
and very bright yellow flowers which are common in dry fields.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>S. lanceolata</i> has lance-shaped or linear leaves, and flowers
which grow in flat-topped clusters, unlike other members of the
family; the information that this is a golden-rod often creates
surprise, as for some strange reason it seems to be confused with
the tansy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sweet golden-rod, <i>S. odorata</i>, is easily recognized by
its fragrant, shining, dotted leaves. <i>S. cæsia</i>, or the blue-stemmed,
is a wood-species and among the latest of the year,
putting forth its bright clusters for nearly the whole length of
its stem long after many of its brethren look like brown wraiths
of their former selves. The silver rod, <i>S. bicolor</i>, whose whitish
flowers are a departure from the family habit, also survives
the early cold and holds its own in the dry woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>The only species native to Great Britain is <i>S. Virga-aurea</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The generic name is from two Greek words which signify <i>to

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>When we see these great yellow disks peeping over the pasture
walls or flanking the country lanes, we feel that midsummer
is at its height. Flowers are often subservient courtiers, and
make acknowledgment of whatever debt they owe by that
subtlest of flatteries—imitation. Did not the blossoms of the
dawning year frequently wear the livery of the snow which had
thrown its protecting mantle over their first efforts? And these
newcomers—whose gross, rotund countenances so clearly betray
the results of high living—do not they pay their respects to their
great benefactor after the same fashion?—with the result that a
myriad miniature suns shine upward from meadow and roadside.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stout, mucilaginous root of this plant is valued by farmers
as a horse-medicine, especially in epidemics of epizootic, one
of its common names in England being horse-heal.</p>

<p class='c004'>In ancient times the elecampane was considered an important
stimulant to the human brain and stomach, and it was mentioned
as such in the writings of Hippocrates, the “Father of

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>In late summer many of our lanes are hedged by this beautiful
plant, which, like other members of its family, lifts its yellow
flowers sunward in pale imitation of the great life-giver itself.
We have twenty-two different species of sunflower. <i>H. divaricatus</i>
is of a lower growth, with opposite, widely spreading leaves
and larger flower-heads. <i>H. annuus</i> is the garden species familiar
to all; this is said to be a native of Peru. Mr. Ellwanger
writes regarding it: “In the mythology of the ancient Peruvians
it occupied an important place, and was employed as a
mystic decoration in ancient Mexican sculpture. Like the lotus
of the East, it is equally a sacred and an artistic emblem, figuring
in the symbolism of Mexico and Peru, where the Spaniards
found it rearing its aspiring stalk in the fields, and serving in
the temples as a sign and a decoration, the sun-god’s officiating
handmaidens wearing upon their breasts representations of the
sacred flower in beaten gold.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gerarde describes it as follows: “The Indian Sun or the
golden floure of Peru is a plant of such stature and talnesse that
in one Sommer, being sowne of a seede in April, it hath risen up
to the height of fourteen foot in my garden, where one floure
was in weight three pound and two ounces, and crosse overthwart
the floure by measure sixteen inches broad.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>If one were only describing the attractive wild flowers, the
stick-tight would certainly be omitted, as its appearance is not
prepossessing, and the small barbed seed-vessels so cleverly fulfil
their destiny in making one’s clothes a means of conveyance to
“fresh woods and pastures new” as to cause all wayfarers
heartily to detest them. “How surely the desmodium growing
on some cliff-side, or the bidens on the edge of a pool, prophesy
the coming of the traveller, brute or human, that will transport
their seeds on his coat,” writes Thoreau. But the plant is so
constantly encountered in late summer, and yet so generally unknown,
that it can hardly be overlooked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The larger bur marigold, <i>B. chrysanthemoides</i>, does its best
to retrieve the family reputation for ugliness, and surrounds its
dingy disk-flowers with a circle of showy golden rays which
are strictly decorative, having neither pistils nor stamens, and
leaving all the work of the household to the less attractive but
more useful disk-flowers. Their effect is pleasing, and late into
the autumn the moist ditches look as if sown with gold through
their agency. The plant varies in height from six inches to two
feet. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and regularly toothed.</p>

<p class='c004'>These large pale yellow flowers are very beautiful and striking
when seen in the dry woods of late summer. They are all
the more appreciated because there are few flowers abroad at
this season save the Composites, which are decorative and radiant
enough, but usually somewhat lacking in the delicate charm we
look for in a flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>The members of this genus, which is named after Gerarde,
the author of the famous “Herball,” are supposed to be more
or less parasitic in their habits, drawing their nourishment from
the roots of other plants.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the name of tansy we seem to catch a whiff of its
strong-scented breath and a glimpse of some New England
homestead beyond whose borders it has strayed to deck the
roadside with its deep yellow, flat-topped flower-clusters. The
plant has been used in medicine since the Middle Ages, and in
more recent times it has been gathered by the country people
for “tansy wine” and “tansy tea.” In the Roman Church
it typifies the bitter herbs which were to be eaten at the Paschal
season; and cakes made of eggs and its leaves are called “tansies,”
and eaten during Lent. It is also frequently utilized in
more secular concoctions.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>It seems as though the flowers of the witch-hazel were fairly
entitled to the “booby-prize,” of the vegetable world. Surely
no other blossoms make their first appearance so invariably late
upon the scene of action. The fringed gentian often begins to
open its “meek and quiet eye” quite early in September.
Certain species of golden-rod and aster continue to flower till
late in the year, but they began putting forth their bright clusters
before the summer was fairly over; while the elusively fragrant,
pale yellow blossoms of the witch-hazel need hardly be
expected till well on in September, when its leaves have fluttered
earthward and its fruit has ripened. Does the pleasure which
we experience at the spring-like apparition of this leafless yellow-flowered
shrub in the autumn woods arise from the same depraved
taste which is gratified by strawberries at Christmas, I
wonder? Or is it that in the midst of death we have a foretaste
of life; a prophecy of the great yearly resurrection which
even now we may anticipate?</p>

<p class='c004'>Thoreau’s tastes in such directions were certainly not depraved,
and he writes: “The witch-hazel loves a hill-side with
or without woods or shrubs. It is always pleasant to come upon
it unexpectedly as you are threading the woods in such places.
Methinks I attribute to it some elfish quality apart from its fame.
I love to behold its gray speckled stems.” Under another date
he writes: “Heard in the night a snapping sound, and the fall
of some small body on the floor from time to time. In the
morning I found it was produced by the witch-hazel nuts on my
desk springing open and casting their seeds quite across my
chamber, hard and stony as these nuts were.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Indians long ago discovered the value of its bark for medicinal
purposes, and it is now utilized in many well-known
extracts. The forked branches formerly served as divining-rods
in the search for water and precious ores. This belief in its
mysterious power very possibly arose from its suggestive title,
which Dr. Prior says should be spelled <i>wych</i>-hazel, as it was
called after the wych-elm, whose leaves it resembles, and which
was so named because the chests termed in old times “wyches”
were made of its wood—</p>

Whether they owe this name to the ship which is responsible
for so much, or to their season of blooming, in certain localities,
might remain an open question had we not the authority of
Whittier for attributing it to both causes. In a note prefacing
“The Mayflowers,” the poet says: “The trailing arbutus or

<p class='c004'>If the poet’s fancy was founded on fact, and if our lovely and
wide-spread Mayflower was indeed the first blossom noted and
christened by our forefathers, it seems as though the problem of
a national flower must be solved by one so lovely and historic as
to silence all dispute. And when we read the following prophetic
stanzas which close the poem, showing that during another
dark period in our nation’s history these brave little blossoms,
struggling through the withered leaves, brought a message of
hope and courage to the heroic heart of the Quaker poet, our
feeling that they are peculiarly identified with our country’s
perilous moments is intensified:</p>

to his possession of that appreciation of the beautiful which is
supposed to be lacking in men of long scientific training. I believe
that there is extant at least one contemporary portrait of

the excitement of the latter is apt to be whetted with the hope
of beholding a marvellous imitation of bee or butterfly fluttering

from the air! While this little plant is sure to fail of satisfying
the hopes of either, it is far prettier if less rare than many of its

<p class='c013'>writes Elaine Goodale of the moccason-flower. This is a blossom
whose charm never wanes. It seems to be touched with
the spirit of the deep woods, and there is a certain fitness in its
Indian name, for it looks as though it came direct from the home
of the red man. All who have found it in its secluded haunts
will sympathize with Mr. Higginson’s feeling that each specimen
is a rarity, even though he should find a hundred to an acre.
Gray assigns it to “dry or moist woods,” while Mr. Baldwin
writes: “The finest specimens I ever saw sprang out of cushions
of crisp reindeer moss high up among the rocks of an exposed
hill-side, and again I have found it growing vigorously in
almost open swamps, but nearly colorless from excessive moisture.”
The same writer quotes a lady who is familiar with it in
the Adirondacks. She says: “It seems to have a great fondness
for decaying wood, and I often see a whole row perched like
birds along a crumbling log.” While I recall a mountain lake
where the steep cliffs rise from the water’s edge, here and there,
on a tiny shelf strewn with pine-needles, can be seen a pair of
large veiny leaves, above which, in early June, the pink balloon-like
blossom floats from its slender scape.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>In the last century the name of Mayflower was given to the
shrub by the Swedes in the neighborhood of Philadelphia.
Peter Kalm, the pupil of Linnæus, after whom our laurel, <i>Kalmia</i>,
is named, writes the following description of the shrub in
his “Travels,” which were published in English in 1771, and
which explain the origin of one of its titles: “Some of the
Swedes and Dutch call them Pinxter-bloem (Whitsunday-flower)
as they really are in bloom about Whitsuntide; and at a distance
they have some similarity to the Honeysuckle or ‘Lonicera.’...
Its flowers were now open and added a new ornament
to the woods.... They sit in a circle round the stem’s
extremity and have either a dark red or a lively red color; but
by standing for some time the sun bleaches them, and at last they
get to a whitish hue.... They have some smell, but I
cannot say it is very pleasant. However, the beauty of the
flower entitles them to a place in every flower-garden.” While
our pink azalea could hardly be called “dark red” under any
circumstances, it varies greatly in the color of its flowers.</p>

for it—woods of mingled oak, chestnut, pine, and hemlock,—and
were about giving it up when suddenly we came upon a
gay company of them beside an old wood-road. It was as if a

found growing in roadside thickets, with bright, pretty
foliage, and blossoms that appear in early summer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hedge Bindweed.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Convolvulus Americanus.</i> Convolvulus Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Twining or trailing. <i>Leaves.</i>—Somewhat arrow-shaped.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Pink. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of five sepals enclosed in two broad leafy bracts.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Five-lobed, bell-shaped. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with

<p class='c004'>Many an unsightly heap of rubbish left by the roadside is
hidden by the delicate pink bells of the hedge bindweed, which
again will clamber over the thickets that line the streams and
about the tumbled stone-wall that marks the limit of the pasture.
The pretty flowers at once suggest the morning-glory, to
which they are closely allied.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common European bindweed, <i>C. arvensis</i>, has white or
pinkish flowers, without bracts beneath the calyx, and a low procumbent
or twining stem. It has taken possession of many of
our old fields where it spreads extensively and proves troublesome
to farmers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>This flower betrays its relationship to the wild rose, and
might easily be mistaken for it, although a glance at the undivided
leaves would at once correct such an error. The plant is
a decorative one when covered with its showy blossoms, constantly
arresting our attention along the wooded roadsides in
June and July.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pale Corydalis.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Corydalis glauca.</i> Fumitory Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Pale, divided into delicate
leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Pink and yellow, in loose clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of two
small, scale-like sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Pink, tipped with yellow; closed and
flattened, of four petals, with a short spur at the base of the upper petal.
<i>Stamens.</i>—Six, maturing before the pistil, thus avoiding self-fertilization.
<i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the rocky clefts in the summer woods springs the pale
corydalis, its graceful foliage dim with a whitish bloom, and its
delicate rosy, yellow-tipped flowers betraying by their odd flat
corollas their kinship with the Dutchman’s breeches and squirrel
corn of the early year, as well as with the bleeding hearts of
the garden. Thoreau assigns them to the middle of May, and
says they are “rarely met with,” which statement does not coincide
with the experience of those who find the rocky woodlands
each summer abundantly decorated with their fragile clusters.</p>

<p class='c004'>The generic name, <i>Corydalis</i>, is the ancient Greek title for the
crested lark, and said to refer to the crested seeds of this genus.
The specific title, <i>glauca</i>, refers to the pallor of leaves and stem.</p>

<p class='c004'>The golden corydalis, <i>C. aurea</i>, is found on rocky banks
somewhat westward.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Common Milkweed.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Asclepias Cornuti.</i> Milkweed Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Tall, stout, downy, with a milky juice. <i>Leaves.</i>—Generally
opposite or whorled, the upper sometimes scattered, large, oblong, pale,
minutely downy underneath. <i>Flowers.</i>—Dull, purplish-pink, clustered at
the summit and along the sides of the stem. (These flowers are too difficult
to be successfully analyzed by the non-botanist.) <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-parted, the
divisions small and reflexed. <i>Corolla.</i>—Deeply five-parted, the divisions
reflexed; above them a crown of five hooded nectaries, each containing an
incurved horn. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five, inserted on the base of the corolla, united
with each other and enclosing the pistils. <i>Pistils.</i>—Properly two, enclosed
by the stamens, surmounted by a large five-angled disk. <i>Fruit.</i>—Two pods,
one of which is large and full of silky-tufted seeds, the other often stunted.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is probably the commonest representative of this striking
and beautiful native family. The tall, stout stems, large,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>pale leaves, dull pink clustered flowers which appear in July,
and later the puffy pods filled with the silky-tufted seeds beloved
of imaginative children, are familiar to nearly everyone who
spends a portion of the year in the country. The young sprouts
are said to make an excellent pot-herb; the silky hairs of the
seed-pods have been used for the stuffing of pillows and mattresses,
and can be mixed with flax or wool and woven to advantage;
while paper has been manufactured from the stout
stalks.</p>

<p class='c004'>The four-leaved milkweed, <i>A. quadrifolia</i>, is the most delicate
member of the family, with fragrant rose-tinged flowers
which appear on the dry wooded hill-sides quite early in June,
and slender stems which are usually leafless below, and with one
or two whorls and one or two pairs of oval, taper-pointed leaves
above.</p>

<p class='c004'>The swamp milkweed, <i>A. incarnata</i>, grows commonly in
moist places. Its very leafy stems are two or three feet high,
with narrowly oblong, pointed leaves. Its intense purple-pink
flowers gleam from the wet meadows nearly all summer. They
are smaller than those of the purple milkweed, <i>A. purpurascens</i>,
which abounds in dry ground, and which may be classed among
the deep pink or purple flowers according to the eye of the beholder.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Herb Robert.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Geranium Robertianum.</i> Geranium Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Forking, slightly hairy. <i>Leaves.</i>—Three, divided, the divisions

<i>Corolla.</i>—Of five petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Ten. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with five styles
which split apart in fruit.</p>

<p class='c004'>From June until October many of our shaded woods and
glens are abundantly decorated by the bright blossoms of the
herb Robert. The reddish stalks of the plant have won it the
name of “red-shanks” in the Scotch Highlands. Its strong scent
is caused by a resinous secretion which exists in several of the
geraniums. In some species this resin is so abundant that the
stems will burn like torches, yielding a powerful and pleasant
perfume. The common name is said to have been given the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>plant on account of its supposed virtue in a disease which was
known as “Robert’s plague,” after Robert, Duke of Normandy.
In some of the early writers it is alluded to as the “holy herb of
Robert.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In fruit the styles of this plant split apart with an elasticity
which serves to project the seeds to a distance, it is said, of
twenty-five feet.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Bush Clover.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Lespedeza procumbens.</i> Pulse Family (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stems.</i>—Slender, trailing, and prostrate. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into three
clover-like leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, purplish-pink, veiny. <i>Pod.</i>—Small,
rounded, flat, one-seeded.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of this plant often have the appearance of springing
directly from the earth amid a mass of clover leaves. They
are common in dry soil in the late summer and autumn, as are
the other members of the same genus.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>L. reticulata</i> is an erect, very leafy species with similar
blossoms, which are chiefly clustered near the upper part of the
stem. The bush clovers betray at once their kinship with the
tick-trefoils, but are usually found in more sandy, open places.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>L. polystachya</i> has upright wand-like stems from two to four
feet high. Its flowers grow in oblong spikes on elongated stalks.
Those of <i>L. capitata</i> are clustered in globular heads.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Tick-trefoil.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Desmodium Canadense.</i> Pulse Family (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Hairy, three to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into three somewhat
oblong leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, dull purplish-pink, growing
in densely flowered racemes. <i>Pod.</i>—Flat, deeply lobed on the lower margin,
from one to three inches long, roughened with minute hooked hairs by means
of which they adhere to animals and clothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Great masses of color are made by these flowers in the bogs
and rich woods of midsummer. They are effective when seen in
the distance, but rather disappointing on closer examination,
and will hardly bear gathering or transportation. They are by
far the largest and most showy of the genus.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a smaller, less noticeable plant than <i>D. Canadense</i>.
It flourishes abundantly in dry woods, where it often takes possession
in late summer to the exclusion of nearly all other flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of <i>D. acuminatum</i> grow in an elongated raceme
from a stem about whose summit the leaves, divided into very
large leaflets, are crowded; otherwise it resembles <i>D. nudiflorum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>D. Dillenii</i> grows to a height of from two to five feet, with
erect leafy stems and medium-sized flowers. It is found commonly
in open woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many of us who do not know these plants by name have
uttered various imprecations against their roughened pods.
Thoreau writes: “Though you were running for your life, they
would have time to catch and cling to your clothes.... These
almost invisible nets, as it were, are spread for us, and whole
coveys of desmodium and bidens seeds steal transportation out
of us. I have found myself often covered, as it were, with an
imbricated coat of the brown desmodium seeds or a bristling
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of beggar-ticks, and had to spend a quarter of
an hour or more picking them off in some convenient spot; and
so they get just what they wanted—deposited in another place.”</p>

their belongings, in the shape of children, chickens, and cattle.
She comes to us from England, and her “feminine comeliness
and bounce” suggest to Mr. Burroughs a Yorkshire housemaid.
The generic name is from <i>sapo</i>—soap, and refers to the lather

<p class='c004'>The pink spires of this shrub justify its rather unpoetic name
of steeple-bush. It is closely allied to the meadow-sweet (Pl.
XXVI.), blossoming with it in low grounds during the summer.
It differs from that plant in the color of its flowers and in the
woolliness of its stems and the lower surface of its leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'>In July and August we find these little flowers in our eastern

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>One who has seen an inland marsh in August aglow with
this beautiful plant, is almost ready to forgive the Old Country
some of the many pests she has shipped to our shores in view of
this radiant acquisition. The botany locates it anywhere between
Nova Scotia and Delaware. It may be seen in the perfection
of its beauty along the marshy shores of the Hudson and
in the swamps of the Wallkill Valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>When we learn that these flowers are called “long purples,”

<p class='c013'>Dr. Prior, however, says that it is supposed that Shakespeare
intended to designate the purple-flowering orchis, <i>O. mascula</i>,
which is said to closely resemble the showy orchis (Pl. LXII.)
of our spring woods.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of the purple loosestrife are especially interesting
to botanists on account of their <i>trimorphism</i>, which word
signifies <i>occurring in three forms</i>, and refers to the stamens and
pistils, which vary in size in the different blossoms, being of
three different lengths, the pollen from any given set of stamens
being especially fitted to fertilize a pistil of corresponding length.</p>

with long curved anthers. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is always a pleasant surprise to happen upon a bright patch
of these delicate deep-hued flowers along the marshes or in the
sandy fields of midsummer. Their fragile beauty is of that order
which causes it to seem natural that they should belong to a
genus which is the sole northern representative of a tropical family.
In parts of New England they grow in profusion, while in
Arkansas the plant is said to be a great favorite with the deer,
hence one of its common names. The flower has been likened
to a scarlet evening primrose, and there is certainly a suggestion
of the evening primrose in the four rounded, slightly heart-shaped
petals. The protruding stamens, with their long yellow anthers,
are conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the dry fields and along the roadsides of late summer this

is curved sideways, with its lobes so closed and twisted as
to be inaccessible on their stigmatic surfaces to the pollen which
the already mature stamens are discharging. When the effete
anthers give evidence that they are <i>hors de combat</i> by their withered
appearance, the style erects itself and spreads its stigmas.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>S. angularis</i> is a species which may be found in rich soil inland.
Its somewhat heart-shaped, clasping, five-nerved leaves
and angled stem serve to identify it.</p>

<p class='c004'>If one has been so unlucky, from the usual point of view, or

as to find himself in a rich marsh early in August, his eye
is likely to fall upon the small, pretty pinkish flowers and pale
clasping leaves of the marsh St. John’s-wort. A closer inspection
will discover that the foliage is dotted with the pellucid
glands, and that the stamens are clustered in groups after the
family fashion. Should the same marsh be visited a few weeks
later dashes of vivid color will guide one to the spot where the

<p class='c004'>When the beautiful rose mallow slowly unfolds her pink banner-like
petals and admits the eager bee to her stores of golden
pollen, then we feel that the summer is far advanced. As truly
as the wood anemone and the blood-root seem filled with the
essence of spring and the promise of the opening year, so does
this stately flower glow with the maturity and fulfilment of late
summer. Here is none of the timorousness of the early blossoms
which peep shyly out, as if ready to beat a hasty retreat should
a late frost overtake them, but rather a calm assurance that the
time is ripe, and that the salt marshes and brackish ponds are
only awaiting their rosy lining.</p>

<p class='c004'>The marsh mallow, whose roots yield the mucilaginous substance
utilized in the well-known confection, is <i>Althæa officinalis</i>,
an emigrant from Europe. It is a much less common plant
than the <i>Hibiscus</i>, its pale pink flowers being found in some of
the salt marshes of New England and New York.</p>

<p class='c004'>The common mallow, <i>Malva rotundifolia</i>, which overruns the
country dooryards and village waysides, is a little plant with
rounded, heart-shaped leaves and small purplish flowers. It is
used by the country people for various medicinal purposes and is
cultivated and commonly boiled with meat in Egypt. Job pictures
himself as being despised by those who had been themselves
so destitute as to “cut up mallows by the bushes&#160;... for
their meat.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>In midsummer this striking plant begins to mass its deep-hued
blossoms along the roadsides and low meadows. It is supposed
to flourish with especial abundance in land that has newly
been burned over; hence, its common name of fireweed. Its
willow-like foliage has given it its other English title. The
likeness between the blossoms of this plant and those of the
evening primrose betray their kinship. When the stamens of
the fireweed first mature and discharge their pollen the still immature
style is curved backward and downward with its stigmas
closed. Later it straightens and lengthens to its full dimensions,
so spreading its four stigmas as to be in position to receive the
pollen of another flower from the visiting bee.</p>

the same season. With the deep purple of the iron-weed it gives
variety to the intense hues which herald the coming of autumn.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Joe Pye” is said to have been the name of an Indian who
cured typhus fever in New England by means of this plant. The

very interesting now, with its slender dense racemes of rose-tinted
flowers, apparently without leaves, rising cleanly out of the sand.
It looks warm and brave, a foot or more high, and mingled with
deciduous blue curls. It is much divided, with many spreading,
slender-racemed branches, with inconspicuous linear leaves, reminding
me, both by its form and its colors, of a peach-orchard
in blossom, especially when the sunlight falls on it; minute rose-tinted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>flowers that brave the frosts, and advance the summer into
fall, warming with their color sandy hill-sides and deserts, like
the glow of evening reflected on the sand, apparently all flower
and no leaf. Rising apparently with clean bare stems from the
sand, it spreads out into this graceful head of slender, rosy racemes,
wisp-like. This little desert of less than an acre blushes
with it.”</p>

make so light-hearted and sweeping a claim for ourselves, yet
many will admit the soothing power of which the woods and

lives in close sympathy with nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>About the columbine there is a daring loveliness which
stamps it on the memories of even those who are not ordinarily
minute observers. It contrives to secure a foothold in the most
precipitous and uncertain of nooks, its jewel-like flowers gleaming
from their lofty perches with a graceful <i>insouciance</i> which
awakens our sportsmanlike instincts and fires us with the ambition
to equal it in daring and make its loveliness our own. Perhaps
it is as well if our greediness be foiled and we get a tumble
for our pains, for no flower loses more with its surroundings
than the columbine. Indeed, these destructive tendencies which
are strong within most of us generally defeat themselves by decreasing
our pleasure in a blossom the moment we have ruthlessly
and without purpose snatched it from its environment. If we
honestly wish to study its structure, or to bring into our homes
for preservation a bit of the woods’ loveliness, its interest and
beauty are sure to repay us. But how many pluck every striking
flower they see only to toss it carelessly aside when they
reach their destination, if they have not already dropped it by
the way. Surely if in such small matters sense and self-control
were inculcated in children, more would grow up to the poet’s

<p class='c004'>The name of columbine is derived from <i>colomba</i>—a dove, but
its significance is disputed. Some believe that it was associated
with the bird-like claws of the blossom; while Dr. Prior maintains
that it refers to the “resemblance of its nectaries to the
heads of pigeons in a ring around a dish, a favorite device of
ancient artists.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The meaning of the generic title is also doubtful. Gray derives
it from <i>aquilegus</i>—water-drawing, but gives no further explanation,
while other writers claim that it is from <i>aquila</i>, an
eagle, seeing a likeness to the talons of an eagle in the curved
nectaries.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>This wake robin is one of the few self-assertive flowers of the

to whether the spring had really come to stay, but no such lack
of confidence possesses our brilliant young friend, who almost
flaunts her lurid petals in your face, as if to force upon you the
welcome news that the time of birds and flowers is at hand.
Pretty and suggestive as is the common name, it is hardly appropriate,
as the robins have been on the alert for many days before
our flower unfurls its crimson signal. Its odor is most unpleasant.
Its reddish fruit is noticeable in the woods of late
summer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sessile trillium, <i>T. sessile</i>, has no separate flower-stalk,
its red or greenish blossom being set close to the stem-leaves.
Its petals are narrower, and its leaves are often blotched or
spotted. Its berry is globular, six-angled, and red or purplish.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wake robins are native to North America, only one

<p class='c004'>The bright flowers of the wood betony are found in our May

Near Philadelphia they are said to be among the very earliest
of the flowers, coming soon after the trailing arbutus. In
the later year the plant attracts attention by its uncouth spikes
of brown seed-pods.</p>

<p class='c004'>Few wayside weeds have been accredited with greater virtue
than the ancient betony, which a celebrated Roman physician
claimed could cure forty-seven different disorders. The Roman
proverb, “Sell your coat and buy betony,” seems to imply that
the plant did not flourish so abundantly along the Appian Way
as it does by our American roadsides. Unfortunately we are
reluctantly forced to believe once more that our native flower is

<p class='c004'>But we need not go to the prairie in order to see this plant,
for it is equally abundant in certain low sandy New England
meadows as well as in the near vicinity of New York City.
Under date of June 3d, Thoreau graphically describes its appearance
near Concord, Mass.: “The painted cup is in its
prime. It reddens the meadow, painted-cup meadow. It is a
splendid show of brilliant scarlet, the color of the cardinal-flower,
and surpassing it in mass and profusion.... I do
not like the name. It does not remind me of a cup, rather of a
flame when it first appears. It might be called flame flower, or
scarlet tip. Here is a large meadow full of it, and yet very few
in the town have ever seen it. It is startling to see a leaf thus
brilliantly painted, as if its tip were dipped into some scarlet
tincture, surpassing most flowers in intensity of color.”</p>

at their base. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with three-lobed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here and there in the shadowy woods is a vivid dash of color
made by some wild red lily which has caught a stray sunbeam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>in its glowing cup. The purple spots on its sepals guide the
greedy bee to the nectar at their base; we too can take the hint
and reap a sweet reward if we will, after which we are more in
sympathy with those eager, humming bees.</p>

<p class='c004'>This erect, deep-hued flower is so different from its nodding
sister of the meadows, that we wonder that the two should be so
often confused. When seen away from its surroundings it has
less charm perhaps than either the yellow or the Turk’s cap lily;
but when it rears itself in the cool depths of its woodland home
we feel the uniqueness of its beauty.</p>

Oriental poets to any beautiful flower.</p>

of growth which is common to it in some of the New England

five-lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One. <i>Fruit.</i>—A large
nutlet roughened with barbed or hooked prickles.</p>

<p class='c004'>This coarse plant, whose disagreeable odor strongly suggests
mice, is not only a troublesome weed in pasture-land but a
special annoyance to wool-growers, as its prickly fruit adheres
with pertinacity to the fleece of sheep. Its common name is a
translation of its generic title and refers to the shape and texture
of the leaves. The dull red flowers appear in summer.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Butterfly-weed. Pleurisy-root.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Asclepias tuberosa.</i> Milkweed Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Rough and hairy, one or two feet high, erect, very leafy, branching
at the summit, without milky juice. <i>Leaves.</i>—Linear to narrowly lance-shaped.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Bright orange-red, in flat-topped, terminal clusters,
otherwise closely resembling those of the common milkweed (p. <a href='#Page_192'>192</a>.) <i>Fruit.</i>—Two
hoary erect pods, one of them often stunted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Few if any of our native plants add more to the beauty of the
midsummer landscape than the milkweeds, and of this family no
member is more satisfying to the color-craving eye than the
gorgeous butterfly-weed, whose vivid flower-clusters flame from
the dry sandy meadows with such luxuriance of growth as to
seem almost tropical. Even in the tropics one hardly sees anything
more brilliant than the great masses of color made by
these flowers along some of our New England railways in July,
while farther south they are said to grow even more profusely.
Its gay coloring has given the plant its name of butterfly-weed,
while that of pleurisy-root arose from the belief that
the thick, deep root was a remedy for pleurisy. The Indians
used it as food and prepared a crude sugar from the flowers; the
young seed-pods they boiled and ate with buffalo-meat. The
plant is worthy of cultivation and is easily transplanted, as the
fleshy roots when broken in pieces form new plants. Oddly
enough, at the Centennial much attention was attracted by
a bed of these beautiful plants which were brought from Holland.
Truly, flowers like prophets are not without honor save
in their own country.</p>

account of its black hairs and after a comedy of the same title

<p class='c004'>We have so few red flowers that when one flashes suddenly

Then red flowers know so well how to enhance their beauty by
seeking an appropriate setting. They select the rich green backgrounds
only found in moist, shady places, and are peculiarly
charming when associated with a lonely marsh or a mountain
brook. The bee balm especially haunts these cool nooks, and
its rounded flower-clusters touch with warmth the shadows of
the damp woods of midsummer. The Indians named the flower
<i>O-gee-chee</i>—flaming flower, and are said to have made a tea-like

<p class='c013'>soon after the late snows have melted. Indeed these fragile-looking,
enamel-like flowers are sometimes found actually beneath
the snow, and form one of the many instances which we
encounter among flowers, as among their human contemporaries,
where the frail and delicate-looking withstand storm and
stress far better than their more robust-appearing brethren.
We welcome these tiny newcomers with especial joy, not alone
for their delicate beauty, but because they are usually the first
of all the flowers upon the scene of action, if we rule out the
never-tardy skunk-cabbage. The rusty leaves of last summer
are obliged to suffice for the plant’s foliage until some little time
after the blossoms have appeared, when the young fresh leaves
begin to uncurl themselves. Some one has suggested that the
fuzzy little buds look as though they were still wearing their
furs as a protection against the wintry weather which so often
stretches late into our spring. The flowers vary in color from a
lovely blue to pink or white. They are found chiefly in the
woods, but occasionally on the sunny hill-sides as well.</p>

<p class='c004'>The generic name, <i>Hepatica</i>, is from the Greek for liver, and
was probably given to the plant on account of the shape of its
leaf. Dr. Prior says that “in consequence of this fancied likeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>it was used as a remedy for liver complaints, the common
people having long labored under the belief that nature indicated
in some such fashion the uses to which her creations

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The flowers are among those which botanists term “dimorphous.”
This word signifies <i>occurring in two forms</i>, and refers
to the stamens and pistils, which vary in size, some flowers having
a tall pistil and short stamens, others tall stamens and a short
pistil. Darwin has proved, not only that one of these flowers
can seldom fully fertilize itself, but that usually the blossoms
with tall pistils must be fertilized with pollen from the tall stamens,
and that the short pistils are only acted upon by the short
stamens. With a good magnifier and a needle these two forms
can easily be studied. This is one of the many interesting safeguards
against close-fertilization.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The large nodding flower of the pitcher-plant may be found
during June in the peat-bogs of New England as well as farther
south and west. It is less familiar to most people than the
curious pitcher-like leaves, which are usually partially filled with
water and drowned insects; part of their inner surface being
covered with a sugary exudation, below which, for a space, they
are highly polished, while on the lower portion grow the stiff
bristles which point downward. Insects attracted by the sugary
secretion find themselves prisoners, as they can seldom fight
their way through the opposing bristles, neither can they usually
escape by such a perpendicular flight as would be necessary from
the form of the cavity. The decomposed bodies of these unfortunates
are supposed to contribute to the nourishment of the
plant, as it is hardly probable that this elaborate contrivance
answers no special purpose.</p>

They are of peculiar interest because of their close kinship with
the species, <i>G. pratense</i>, which first attracted the attention of
the German scholar, Sprengel, to the close relations existing between
flowers and insects. The beak-like appearance of its fruit
give the plant both its popular and scientific names, for <i>geranium</i>
is from the Greek for crane. The specific title, <i>maculatum</i>, refers
to the somewhat blotched appearance of the older leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>As the pleasant aroma of its leaves suggest, this little plant
is closely allied to the catnip. Its common title of Gill-over-the-ground,
appeals to one who is sufficiently without interest in
pasture-land (for it is obnoxious to cattle) to appreciate the
pleasant fashion in which this little immigrant from Europe has
made itself at home here, brightening the earth with such a generous
profusion of blossoms every May. But it is somewhat of
a disappointment to learn that this name is derived from the
French <i>guiller</i>, and refers to its former use in the fermentation of
beer. Oddly enough the name of alehoof, which the plant has
borne in England and which naturally has been supposed to refer
to this same custom, is said by a competent authority (Professor
Earle, of Oxford) to have no connection with it, but to signify
<i>another sort of hofe</i>, <i>hofe</i> being the early English name for the
violet, which resembles these flowers in color.</p>

<p class='c004'>The plant was highly prized formerly as a domestic medicine.

<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>blossoms serve to easily identify it. Under date of June 8th,
Thoreau writes: “The lupine is now in its glory.... It
paints a whole hill-side with its blue, making such a field (if not
meadow) as Proserpine might have wandered in. Its leaf was
made to be covered with dewdrops. I am quite excited by
this prospect of blue flowers in clumps, with narrow intervals,
such a profusion of the heavenly, the Elysian color, as if these
were the Elysian fields.... That is the value of the lupine.

<p class='c004'>This slender, pretty plant, hung with its tremulous flowers,
springs from the rocky cliffs which buttress the river as well as
from those which crown the mountain. I have seen the west
shore of the Hudson bright with its delicate bloom in June, and
the summits of the Catskills tinged with its azure in September.
The drooping posture of these flowers protect their pollen from

be found in the East.</p>

<p class='c004'>The blue-eyed grass belongs to the same family as the showy

<p class='c004'>We borrow from Mr. Burroughs’s “Bunch of Herbs” a description
of this little plant, which blossoms from May till August.
“A pretty and curious little weed, sometimes found growing in
the edge of the garden, is the clasping specularia, a relative of
the harebell and of the European Venus’s looking-glass. Its
leaves are shell-shaped, and clasp the stalk so as to form little
shallow cups. In the bottom of each cup three buds appear
that never expand into flowers, but when the top of the stalk is
reached, one and sometimes two buds open a large, delicate purple-blue
corolla. All the first-born of this plant are still-born
as it were; only the latest, which spring from its summit, attain
to perfect bloom.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The prettiest and most striking of this genus is the larger
skull-cap, <i>S. integrifolia</i>, whose bright blue flowers are about
one inch long, growing in terminal racemes. In June and July
they may be found among the long grass of the roadsides and
meadows. They are easily identified by the curious little appendage
on the upper part of the calyx, which gives to this
genus its common name.</p>

was chosen as the emblem of a royal house, although the especial
flower which Louis VII. of France selected as his badge was probably
white.</p>

<p class='c004'>It will surprise most of us to learn that the common name
which we have borrowed from the French does not signify
“flower-of-the-lily,” as it would if literally translated, but
“flower of Louis,” <i>lis</i> being a corruption of the name of the
king who first adopted it as his badge.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>For the botanist the blue-flag possesses special interest. It
is a conspicuous example of a flower which has guarded itself
against self-fertilization, and which is beautifully calculated to
secure the opposite result. The position of the stamens is such
that their pollen could not easily reach the stigmas of the same
flower, for these are borne on the inner surface of the petal-like,
overarching styles. There is no prospect here of any seed being
set unless the pollen of another flower is secured. Now what are
the chances in favor of this? They are many: In the first
place the blossom is unusually large and showy, from its size and
shape alone almost certain to arrest the attention of the passing
bee; next, the color is not only conspicuous, but it is also one
which has been found to be especially attractive to bees; blue
and purple flowers being particularly sought by these insects.
When the bee reaches the flower he alights on the only convenient
landing-place, one of the recurved sepals; following the
deep purple veins which experience has taught him lead to the
hidden nectar, he thrusts his head below the anther, brushing off
its pollen, which he carries to another flower.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rootstocks of the Florentine species of iris yield the
familiar “orris-root.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The family name is from the Greek for <i>rainbow</i>, on account

almost as common in wet ditches and meadows as its sister, the
common speedwell, is in dry and open places. Some of the

<p class='c004'>In some localities this beautiful flower is very plentiful.
Every June will find certain New England marshes tinged with
its rose-purple blossoms, while in other near and promising bogs
it may be sought vainly for years. At least it may be hoped for
in wet places as far south as North Carolina, its most favorite
haunt being perhaps a cranberry-swamp. Concerning it, Mr.
Burroughs writes: “Arethusa was one of the nymphs who attended
Diana, and was by that goddess turned into a fountain,
that she might escape the god of the river Alpheus, who became
desperately in love with her on seeing her at her bath. Our
Arethusa is one of the prettiest of the orchids, and has been pursued
through many a marsh and quaking-bog by her lovers.
She is a bright pink-purple flower an inch or more long, with
the odor of sweet violets. The sepals and petals rise up and
arch over the column, which we may call the heart of the flower,
as if shielding it. In Plymouth County, Mass., where the Arethusa
seems common, I have heard it called Indian pink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In many countries some of the most beautiful and noticeable
flowers are commonly found in grain-fields. England’s scarlet
poppies flood her farm-lands with glorious color in early summer;
while the bluets lighten the corn-fields of France. Our grain-fields
seem to have no native flower peculiar to them; but often
we find a trespasser of foreign descent hiding among the wheat
or straying to the roadsides in early summer, whose deep-tinted
blossoms secure an instant welcome from the flower-lover if not
from the farmer. “What hurte it doeth among corne! the
spoyle unto bread, as well in colour, taste, and unwholesomeness,
is better known than desired,” wrote Gerarde. The large dark
seeds fill the ground wheat with black specks, and might be
injurious if existing in any great quantity. Its former generic
name was <i>Agrostemma</i>, signifying <i>crown of the fields</i>. Its present
one of <i>Lychnis</i>, signifies <i>a light</i> or <i>lamp</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In earlier times the vervain was beset with classic associations.
It was claimed as the plant which Virgil and other poets
mention as being used for altar-decorations and for the garlands
of sacrificial beasts. It was believed to be the <i>herba sacra</i> of
the ancients, until it was understood that the generic title
<i>Verbena</i> was a word which was applied to branches of any description
which were used in religious rites. It certainly seems,
however, to have been applied to some especial plant in the time
of Pliny, for he writes that no plant was more honored among
the Romans than the sacred <i>Verbena</i>. In more modern times
as well the vervain has been regarded as an “herb of grace,” and
has been gathered with various ceremonies and with the invocation
of a blessing, which began as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hallowed be thou, Vervain,</div>

      <div class='line'>There thou was first found.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was then supposed to be endued with especial virtue, and was
worn on the person to avert disaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time-honored title of Simpler’s joy arose from the remuneration
which this popular plant brought to the “Simplers”—as
the gatherers of medicinal herbs were entitled.</p>

June until September, the short, close spikes of the self-heal can
be found along the roadsides. The botanical name, <i>Brunella</i>,
is a corruption from <i>Prunella</i>, which is taken from the German
for quinsy, for which this plant was considered a certain cure.
It was also used in England as an application to the wounds received
by rustic laborers, as its common names, carpenter’s
herb, hook-heal, and sicklewort, imply. That the French had a
similar practice is proved by an old proverb of theirs to the effect
that “No one wants a surgeon who keeps <i>Prunelle</i>.”</p>

elongated, five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>—Elongated, two-lipped. <i>Stamens.</i>—Two,
elongated. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with style two-lobed at apex.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although the wild bergamot is occasionally found in our
eastern woods, it is far more abundant westward, where it is
found in rocky places in summer. This is a near relative of the
bee balm (Pl. LXXXII.), which it closely resembles in its manner
of growth.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Day-flower.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Commelina Virginica.</i> Spiderwort Family.</span></h4>

ones heart-shaped and clasping, folding so as to enclose the flowers. <i>Flowers.</i>—Blue.

lateral ones partly united. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of three petals, two large, rounded,
pale blue, one small, whitish, and inconspicuous. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six, unequal
in size, three small and sterile, with yellow cross-shaped anthers, three fertile,
one of which is bent inward. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The odd day-flower is so named because its delicate blossoms
only expand for a single morning. At the first glance there seem
to be but two petals which are large, rounded, and of a delicate
shade of blue. A closer examination, however, discovers still
another, so inconspicuous in form and color as to escape the
notice of the casual observer. This inequality recalls the quaint
tradition as to the origin of the plant’s generic name. There
were three brothers Commelin, natives of Holland. Two of
them were botanists of repute, while the tastes of the third had
a less marked botanical tendency. The genus was dedicated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the trio: the two large bright petals commemorating the brother
botanists, while the small and unpretentious one perpetuates the
memory of him who was so unwise as to take little or no interest
in so noble a science. These flowers appear throughout the summer
in cool woods and on moist banks.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Blue Linaria. Blue Toadflax.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Linaria Canadensis.</i> Figwort Family.</span></h4>

<i>Stamens.</i>—Four. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The slender spikes of the blue linaria flank the sandy roadsides
nearly all summer, and even in November we find a few
delicate blossoms still left upon the elongated stems. These
flowers have a certain spirituality which is lacking in their handsome,
self-assertive relation, butter-and-eggs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Spiderwort.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Tradescantia Virginica.</i> Spiderwort Family.</span></h4>

three sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of three petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six, with bearded
filaments. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flowers of the spiderwort, like those of the day-flower, to
which they are nearly allied, are very perishable, lasting only a
few hours. They are found throughout the summer, somewhat
south and westward. The genus is named in honor of Tradescant,

<i>Flowers.</i>—Blue, fading quickly, with an unpleasant odor, growing in a dense
spike. <i>Perianth.</i>—Two-lipped, the upper lip three-lobed and marked with
a double greenish-yellow spot, the lower of three spreading divisions. <i>Stamens.</i>—Six,
three long and protruding, the three others, which are often imperfect,
very short and inserted lower down. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pickerel-weed grows in such shallow water as the pickerel
seek, or else in moist, wet places along the shores of streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>and rivers. We can look for the blue, closely spiked flowers
from late July until some time in September. They are often
found near the delicate arrow-head.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Blueweed. Viper’s Bugloss.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Echium vulgare.</i> Borage Family.</span></h4>

as the blossoms expand. <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>—Of five somewhat
unequal, spreading lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five, protruding, red. <i>Pistil.</i>—One.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the blueweed first came to us from across the sea it
secured a foothold in Virginia. Since then it has gradually
worked its way northward, lining the Hudson’s shores, overrunning
many of the dry fields in its vicinity, and making itself
at home in parts of New England. We should be obliged to
rank it among the “pestiferous” weeds were it not that, as a
rule, it only seeks to monopolize land which is not good for very
much else. The pinkish buds and bright blue blossoms with
their red protruding stamens make a valuable addition, from the
æsthetic point of view, to the bunch of midsummer field-flowers
in which hitherto the various shades of red and yellow have predominated.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>The purple flowers, which at once betray their kinship with
the potato plant, and, in late summer, the bright red berries of
the nightshade, cluster about the fences and clamber over the
moist banks which line the highway. This plant, which was imported
from Europe, usually indicates the presence of civilization.
It is not poisonous to the touch, as is often supposed, and it is
doubtful if the berries have the baneful power attributed to them.
Thoreau writes regarding them: “The Solanum Dulcamara
berries are another kind which grow in drooping clusters. I do
not know any clusters more graceful and beautiful than these
drooping cymes of scented or translucent, cherry-colored elliptical
berries.... They hang more gracefully over the
river’s brim than any pendant in a lady’s ear. Yet they are
considered poisonous; not to look at surely.... But why
should they not be poisonous? Would it not be bad taste to
eat these berries which are ready to feed another sense?”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Great Lobelia.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Lobelia syphilitica.</i> Lobelia Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Leafy, somewhat hairy, one to three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Alternate,
ovate to lance-shaped, thin, irregularly toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>—Rather
large, light blue, spiked. <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-cleft, with a short tube. <i>Corolla.</i>—Somewhat
two-lipped, the upper lip of two rather erect lobes, the lower
spreading and three-cleft. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a fringed stigma.</p>

<p class='c004'>The great lobelia is a striking plant which grows in low
ground, flowering in midsummer. In some places it is called
“High-Belia,” a pun which is supposed to reflect upon the less
tall and conspicuous species, such as the Indian tobacco, <i>L. inflata</i>,
which are found flowering at the same season.</p>

<p class='c004'>If one of its blossoms is examined, the pistil is seen to be enclosed
by the united stamens in such a fashion as to secure self-fertilization,
one would suppose. But it is hardly probable that
a flower as noticeable as this, and wearing a color as popular as
blue, should have adorned itself so lavishly to no purpose. Consequently
we are led to inquire more closely into its domestic
arrangements. Our curiosity is rewarded by the discovery that
the lobes of the stigma are so tightly pressed together that they
can at first receive no pollen upon their sensitive surfaces. We
also find that the anthers open only by a pore at their tips, and
when irritated by the jar of a visiting bee, discharge their pollen
upon its body through these outlets. This being accomplished
the fringed stigma pushes forward, brushing aside whatever
pollen may have fallen within the tube. When it finally
projects beyond the anthers, it opens, and is ready to receive its
pollen from the next insect-visitor.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the summer we note in the dry, open fields the blue
racemes of the Indian tobacco, and in the later year the inflated

poisonous if taken internally, and yields a “quack-medicine” of
some notoriety. The Indians smoked its dried leaves, which impart
to the tongue a peculiar tobacco-like sensation.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>As about one hundred and twenty different species of aster
are native to the United States, and as fifty-four of these are
found in Northeastern America, all but a dozen being purple or
blue (<i>i.e.</i>, with purple or blue ray-flowers), and as even botanists
find that it requires patient application to distinguish these
many species, only a brief description of the more conspicuous
and common ones is here attempted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Along the dry roadsides in early August we may look for the
bright blue-purple flowers of <i>A. patens</i>. This is a low-growing
species, with rough, narrowly oblong, clasping leaves, and widely
spreading branches, whose slender branchlets are usually terminated
by a solitary flower-head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Probably no member of the group is more striking than the
New England aster, <i>A. Novæ Angliæ</i>, whose stout hairy stem
(sometimes eight feet high), numerous lance-shaped leaves, and
large violet-purple or sometimes pinkish flower-heads, are conspicuous
in the swamps of late summer.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>A. puniceus</i> is another tall swamp-species, with long showy
pale lavender ray-flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the most commonly encountered asters is <i>A. cordifolius</i>,
which is far from being the only heart-leaved species, despite
its title. Its many small, pale blue or almost white flower-heads
mass themselves abundantly along the wood-borders and
shaded roadsides.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps the loveliest of all the tribe is the seaside purple
aster, <i>A. spectabilis</i>, a low plant with narrowly oblong leaves
and large bright heads, the violet-purple ray-flowers of which
are nearly an inch long. This grows in sandy soil near the
coast and may be found putting forth its royal, daisy-like blossoms
into November.</p>

<p class='c004'>Great Britain can claim but one native aster, <i>A. Trifolium</i>,
or sea-starwort as it is called. Many American species are cultivated
in English gardens under the general title of Michaelmas
daisies. The starwort of Italy is <i>A. amellus</i>. The Swiss species
is <i>A. Alpinum</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This beautiful genus, like that of the golden-rod, is one of
the peculiar glories of our country. Every autumn these two
kinds of flowers clothe our roadsides and meadows with so regal
a mantle of purple and gold that we cannot but wonder if the
flowers of any other region combine in such a radiant display.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Iron-weed.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Vernonia Noveboracensis.</i> Composite Family (p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>).</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Leafy, usually tall. <i>Leaves.</i>—Alternate, somewhat lance-oblong.
<i>Flower-heads.</i>—An intense red-purple, loosely clustered, composed entirely
of tubular flowers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Along the roadsides and low meadows near the coast the
iron-weed adds its deep purple hues to the color-pageant of late
August. By the uninitiated the plant is often mistaken for an
aster, but a moment’s inspection will discover that the minute
flowers which compose each flower-head are all tubular in shape,
and that the ray or strap-shaped blossoms which an aster must
have are wanting. These flower-heads are surrounded by an
involucre composed of small scales which are tipped with a tiny
point and are usually of a purplish color also.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Blue Curls. Bastard Pennyroyal.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Trichostema dichotomum.</i> Mint Family (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Rather low, branching, clammy. <i>Leaves.</i>—Opposite, narrowly
oblong or lance-shaped, glutinous, with a balsamic odor. <i>Flowers.</i>—Purple,
occasionally pinkish, not usually clustered. <i>Calyx.</i>—Five-cleft, two-lipped.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Five-lobed, the three lower lobes more or less united. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four,
very long and curved, protruding. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a two-lobed style.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the sandy fields of late summer this little plant attracts
notice by its many purple flowers. Its corolla soon falls and
exposes to view the four little nutlets of the ovary lying within
the enlarged calyx like tiny eggs in their nest. Its aromatic
odor is very perceptible, and the little glands with which it is
covered may be seen with the aid of a magnifier. The generic
name, <i>Trichostema</i>, signifies <i>hairy stamens</i> and alludes to the
curved hair-like filaments.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sea Lavender. Marsh Rosemary.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Statice Caroliniana.</i> Leadwort Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stems.</i>—Leafless, branching. <i>Leaves.</i>—From the root, somewhat oblong,
thick. <i>Flowers.</i>—Lavender-color or pale purple, tiny, scattered or
loosely spiked along one side of the branches. <i>Calyx.</i>—Dry, funnel-form.
<i>Corolla.</i>—Small, with five petals. <i>Stamens.</i>—Five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with
five, rarely three, styles.</p>

<p class='c004'>In August many of the salt marshes are blue with the tiny
flowers of the sea lavender. The spray-like appearance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>little plant would seem to account for its name of rosemary,
which is derived from the Latin for <i>sea-spray</i>, but Dr. Prior
states that this name was given it on account of “its usually
growing on the sea-coast, and its odor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Blossoming with the lavender we often find the great rose
mallows and the dainty sea pinks. The marsh St. John’s-wort as
well is frequently a neighbor, and, a little later in the season, the
salt marsh fleabane.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Blazing Star.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Liatris scariosa.</i> Composite Family (p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Simple, stout, hoary, two to five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Alternate,
narrowly lance-shaped. <i>Flower-heads.</i>—Racemed along the upper part of
the stem, composed entirely of tubular flowers of a beautiful shade of rose-purple.</p>

<p class='c004'>These showy and beautiful flowers lend still another tint to
the many-hued salt marshes and glowing inland meadows of the
falling year. Gray assigns them to dry localities from New
England to Minnesota and southward, while my own experience
of them is limited to the New England coast, where their stout
leafy stems and bright-hued blossoms are noticeable among the
golden-rods and asters of September. The hasty observer sometimes
confuses the plant with the iron-weed, but the two flowers
are very different in color and in their manner of growth.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Common Dittany.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Cunila Mariana.</i> Mint Family (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>About one foot high. <i>Stem.</i>—Much branched, reddish. <i>Leaves.</i>—Opposite,
aromatic, dotted, smooth, ovate, rounded or heart-shaped at base,
set close to the stem. <i>Flowers.</i>—Small, purple, lilac or white, clustered.
<i>Calyx.</i>—Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>—Small, two-lipped, the upper lip erect,
usually notched, the lower three-cleft. <i>Stamens.</i>—Two, erect, protruding.
<i>Pistil.</i>—One, with a two-lobed style.</p>

<p class='c004'>In late August or early September the delicate flowers of the
dittany brighten the dry, sterile banks which flank so many of
our roadsides. At a season when few plants are flowering save
the omnipresent members of the great Composite family these
dainty though unpretentious blossoms are especially attractive.
The plant has a pleasant fragrance.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Closed Gentian.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Gentiana Andrewsii.</i> Gentian Family.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—One to two feet high, upright, smooth. <i>Leaves.</i>—Opposite, narrowly
oval or lance-shaped. <i>Flowers.</i>—Blue to purple, clustered at the summit
of the stem and often in the axils of the leaves. <i>Calyx.</i>—Four or
five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>—Closed at the mouth, large, oblong. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four
or five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One, with two stigmas.</p>

<p class='c004'>Few flowers adapt themselves better to the season than the
closed gentian. We look for it in September when the early
waning days and frost-suggestive nights prove so discouraging to
the greater part of the floral world. Then in somewhat moist,
shaded places along the roadside we find this vigorous, autumnal-looking
plant, with stout stems, leaves that bronze as the days
advance, and deep-tinted flowers firmly closed as though to
protect the delicate reproductive organs within from the sharp
touches of the late year.</p>

<p class='c004'>To me the closed gentian usually shows a deep blue or even
purple countenance, although like the fringed gentian and so
many other flowers its color is lighter in the shade than in the
sunlight. But Thoreau claims for it a “transcendent blue,” “a
splendid blue, light in the shade, turning to purple with age.”
“Bluer than the bluest sky, they lurk in the moist and shady
recesses of the banks,” he writes. Mr. Burroughs also finds it
“intensely blue.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Five-flowered Gentian.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Gentiana quinqueflora.</i> Gentian Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Slender, branching, one or two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Opposite,
ovate, lance-shaped, partly clasping. <i>Flowers.</i>—Pale blue, smaller than
those of the closed gentian, in clusters of about five at the summit of stems
and branches. <i>Calyx.</i>—Four or five-cleft, small. <i>Corolla.</i>—Funnel-form,
four or five-lobed, its lobes bristle-pointed. <i>Stamens.</i>—Four or five. <i>Pistil.</i>—One,
with two stigmas.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although the five-flowered gentian is far less frequently encountered
than the closed gentian, it is very common in certain
localities. Gray assigns it to “moist hills” and “along the
mountains to Florida.” I have found it growing in great abundance
on the Shawangunk Mountains in Orange County, N. Y.,
where it flowers in September.</p>

<p class='c013'>for the fringed gentian is fickle in its habits, and the fact that we
have located it one season does not mean that we will find it in
the same place the following year; being a biennial, with seeds
that are easily washed away, it is apt to change its haunts from
time to time. So our search for this plant is always attended
with the charm of uncertainty. Once having ferreted out its
new abiding-place, however, we can satiate ourselves with its
loveliness, which it usually lavishes unstintingly upon the moist
meadows which it has elected to honor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thoreau describes its color as “such a dark blue! surpassing
that of the male bluebird’s back!” My experience has been
that the flowers which grow in the shade are of a clear pure
azure, “Heaven’s own blue,” as Bryant claims; while those
which are found in open, sunny meadows may be justly said to
vie with the back of the male bluebird. If the season has been
a mild one we shall perhaps find a few blossoms lingering into
November, but the plant is probably blighted by a severe frost,
although Miss Emily Dickinson’s little poem voices another
opinion:</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Skunk Cabbage. Swamp Cabbage.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Symplocarpus fœtidus.</i> Arum Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Leaves.</i>—Large, becoming one or two feet long; heart-shaped, appearing
later than the purple-mottled spathe and hidden flowers. <i>Flowers.</i>—Small
and inconspicuous; packed on the fleshy spike which is hidden within the
spathe.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we are bold enough to venture into certain swampy places
in the leafless woods and brown cheerless meadows of March, we
notice that the sharply pointed spathes of the skunk cabbage
have already pierced the surface of the earth. Until I chanced
upon a passage in Thoreau’s Journal under date of October 31st,
I had supposed that these “hermits of the bog” were only
encouraged to make their appearance by the advent of those first
balmy, spring-suggestive days which occasionally occur as early
as February. But it seems that many of these young buds had
pushed their way upward before the winter set in, for Thoreau
counsels those who are afflicted with the melancholy of autumn
to go to the swamps, “and see the brave spears of skunk-cabbage
buds already advanced toward a new year.” “Mortal and human
creatures must take a little respite in this fall of the year,” he
writes. “Their spirits do flag a little. There is a little questioning
of destiny, and thinking to go like cowards to where the
weary shall be at rest. But not so with the skunk-cabbage. Its
withered leaves fall and are transfixed by a rising bud. Winter
and death are ignored. The circle of life is complete. Are
these false prophets? Is it a lie or a vain boast underneath the
skunk-cabbage bud pushing it upward and lifting the dead leaves
with it?”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>The purplish shell-like leaf, which curls about the tiny flowers
which are thus hidden from view, is a rather grewsome-looking
object, suggestive of a great snail when it lifts itself fairly above
its muddy bed. When one sees it grouped with brother-cabbages
it is easy to understand why a nearly allied species, which
abounds along the Italian Riviera, should be entitled “Cappucini”
by the neighboring peasants, for the bowed, hooded
appearance of these plants might easily suggest the cowled
Capuchins.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems unfortunate that our earliest spring flower (for such
it undoubtedly is) should possess so unpleasant an odor as to win
for itself the unpoetic title of skunk cabbage. There is also
some incongruity in the heading of the great floral procession of
the year by the minute hidden blossoms of this plant. That they
are enabled to survive the raw March winds which are rampant
when they first appear is probably due to the protection afforded
them by the leathery leaf or spathe. When the true leaves
unfold they mark the wet woods and meadows with bright
patches of rich foliage, which with that of the hellebore, flash
constantly into sight as we travel through the country in April.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is interesting to remember that the skunk cabbage is nearly
akin to the spotless calla lily, the purple-mottled spathe of the
one answering to the snowy petal-like leaf of the other. Meehan
tells us that the name bear-weed was given to the plant by the
early Swedish settlers in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. It
seems that the bears greatly relished this early green, which
Meehan remarks “must have been a hot morsel, as the juice is
acrid, and is said to possess some narcotic power, while that of
the root, when chewed, causes the eyesight to grow dim.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Certain flowers might be grouped under the head of “vegetable
cranks.” Here would be classed the evening primrose,
which only opens at night, the closed gentian, which never opens
at all, and the wild ginger, whose odd, unlovely flower seeks protection
beneath its long-stemmed fuzzy leaves, and hides its
head upon the ground as if unwilling to challenge comparison
with its more brilliant brethren. Unless already familiar with
this plant there is nothing to tell one when it has reached its
flowering season; and many a wanderer through the rocky woods
in early May quite overlooks its shy, shamefaced blossom.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ginger-like flavor of the rootstock is responsible for its
common name. It grows wild in many parts of Europe and is
cultivated in England, where at one time it was considered a
remedy for headache and deafness.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Jack-in-the-Pulpit. Indian Turnip.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Arisæma triphyllum.</i> Arum Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c004'>These quaint little preachers, ensconced in their delicate pulpits,
are well known to all who love the woods in early spring.
Sometimes these “pulpits” are of a light green veined with a
deeper tint; again they are stained with purple. This difference
in color has been thought to indicate the sex of the flowers
within—the males are said to be shielded by the green, the
females by the purple, hoods. In the nearly allied cuckoo-pints
of England, matters appear to be reversed: these plants are called
“Lords and Ladies” by the children, the purple-tinged ones
being the “Lords,” the light green ones the “Ladies.” The
generic name, <i>Arisæma</i>, signifies <i>bloody arum</i>, and refers to
the dark purple stains of the spathe. An old legend claims that
these were received at the Crucifixion:</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The Indians were in the habit of boiling the bright scarlet
berries which are so conspicuous in our autumn woods and devouring
them with great relish; they also discovered that the
bulb-like base or <i>corm</i>, as it is called, lost its acridity on cooking,
and made nutritious food, winning for the plant its name
of Indian turnip. One of its more local titles is memory-root,
which it owes to a favorite school-boy trick of tempting others
to bite into the blistering corm with results likely to create a
memorable impression.</p>

<p class='c004'>The English cuckoo-pint yielded a starch which was greatly
valued in the time of Elizabethan ruffs, although it proved too
blistering to the hands of the washerwomen to remain long in
use. Owing to the profusion with which the plant grows in
Ireland efforts have been made to utilize it as food in periods of
scarcity. By grating the corm into water, and then pouring off
the liquid and drying the sediment, it is said that a tasteless, but
nutritious, powder can be procured.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>cohosh. The generic name is from two Greek words signifying
<i>stem</i> and <i>leaf</i>, “the stems seeming to form a stalk for the great
leaf.” (Gray.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Early Meadow Rue.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Thalictrum dioicum.</i> Crowfoot Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>One to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into many smooth, lobed, pale,
drooping leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Purplish and greenish, unisexual. <i>Calyx.</i>—Of
four or five petal-like sepals. <i>Corolla.</i>—None. <i>Stamens.</i>—Indefinite
in number, with linear yellowish anthers drooping on hair-like filaments
(stamens and pistils occurring on different plants). <i>Pistils.</i>—Four to fourteen.</p>

<p class='c004'>The graceful drooping foliage of this plant is perhaps more
noticeable than the small flowers which appear in the rocky
woods in April or May.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lily-leaved Liparis.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Liparis liliifolia.</i> Orchis Family (p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Scape.</i>—Low, from a solid bulb. <i>Leaves.</i>—Two, ovate, smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>—Purplish
or greenish, with thread-like reflexed petals and a large brown-purplish
lip an inch and a half long; growing in a raceme.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the moist, rich woods of June we may look for these flowers.
The generic name is derived from two Greek words which
signify <i>fat</i> or <i>shining</i>, in reference to “the smooth or unctuous
leaves.” (Gray.)</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Beechdrops. Cancer-root.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Epiphegus Virginiana.</i> Broom-rape Family.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stems.</i>—Slender, fleshy, branching, with small scales; purplish, yellowish
or brownish. <i>Leaves.</i>—None. <i>Flowers.</i>—Purplish, yellowish or brownish,
spiked or racemed, small, of two kinds, the upper sterile, the lower fertile.</p>

<p class='c004'>These curious-looking plants abound in the shade of beech-trees,
drawing nourishment from their roots. The upper open
flowers are sterile; the lower ones, which never expand, accomplish
the continuance of their kind.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pine Sap. False Beechdrops.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Monotropa Hypopitys.</i> Heath Family.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A low fleshy herb without green foliage; tawny, reddish, or whitish.
<i>Flowers.</i>—Resembling in structure those of the Indian pipe, but clustered
in a raceme.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pine sap is a parasitic plant which is closely allied to
the Indian pipe (Pl. XXI.). Its clustered flowers are usually fragrant.
The plant is commonly of a somewhat tawny hue, but
occasionally one finds a bright red specimen. It flourishes in oak
or pine-woods from June till August.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Rattlesnake-root.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Prenanthes alba.</i></span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Height.</i>—Two to four feet. <i>Leaves.</i>—The lower cleft or toothed, the
uppermost oblong and undivided. <i>Flower-heads.</i>—Nodding, composed of
white or greenish strap-shaped flowers surrounded by a purplish involucre.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lion’s Foot. Gall-of-the-Earth.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Prenanthes serpentaria.</i> Composite Family (p. <a href='#Page_13'>13</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Height.</i>—About two feet. <i>Leaves.</i>—Roughish, the lower lobed, the upper
oblong lance-shaped. <i>Flower-heads.</i>—Nodding, composed of greenish
or cream-colored strap-shaped flowers surrounded by a greenish or purple
involucre.</p>

<p class='c004'>These plants are peculiarly decorative in late summer on account
of their graceful, drooping, bell-shaped flower-heads. The
flowers themselves almost escape notice, and their color is rather
difficult to determine, the purplish or greenish involucre being
the plants’ conspicuous feature.</p>

<p class='c004'>The generic name is from the Greek, and signifies <i>drooping
blossom</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Wild Bean. Ground-nut.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Apios tuberosa.</i> Pulse Family (p. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Stem.</i>—Twining and climbing over bushes. <i>Leaves.</i>—Divided into three
to seven narrowly oval leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>—Papilionaceous, purplish or
chocolate-color, somewhat violet-scented, closely clustered in racemes.</p>

<p class='c004'>In late summer the dark, rich flowers of the wild bean are
found in short, thick clusters among the luxuriant undergrowth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and thickets of low ground. The plant is a climber, bearing
edible pear-shaped tubers on underground shoots, which give it
its generic name signifying <i>a pear</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Coral-root.</span><br> <span class='c016'><i>Corallorhiza multiflora.</i> Orchis Family (p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>).</span></h4>

<p class='c018'><i>Rootstock.</i>—Much branched, coral-like, toothed. <i>Stem.</i>—Nine to eighteen
inches high, without green foliage. <i>Flowers.</i>—Rather small, dull
brownish-purple or yellowish, sometimes mottled with red; growing in a
raceme.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the dry summer woods one frequently encounters the dull
racemes of this rather inconspicuous little plant. It is often
found in the immediate neighborhood of the Indian pipe and
pine sap. Being, like them, without green foliage, it might be
taken for an allied species by the casual observer. This is one
of those orchids which are popularly considered unworthy to
bear the name, giving rise to so much incredulity or disappointment
in the unbotanical.</p>
